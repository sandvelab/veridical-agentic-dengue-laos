# Batch reports

One report per executed batch of
`Human-input/Plans for AI generation/26-08-22_dengueForecastingCase.md`. The plan is run one
batch per invocation of `/do`; each batch writes its report here and links it from the plan's
batch ledger.

Named `YY-MM-DD_bNN_camelCaseName.md`, where `NN` is the batch number. **A report is never
overwritten.** If a batch is redone, the new report is a new file and both stay.

Every batch ends in exactly one of three states, stated at the top of its report:

- **done — produced** — it created or changed something in the analysis, and the report says
  what and where;
- **done — expanded** — it produced no analysis output but replaced itself with more concrete
  batches, and the report says what made those possible;
- **blocked** — it could not proceed, and the report says exactly what is missing and what
  would unblock it.

These reports are the project's own running account of itself, so they are not regenerable
in the way the rest of `AI-generated/` is: they record what happened at a point in time, and
re-running a batch produces a different report rather than the same one.

## Currently here

- `26-08-23_b01_orientAndSetUp.md` — batch 1, phase A: orientation and repository set-up.
- `26-08-23_b02_chapSetup.md` — batch 2, phase A: installing and pinning `chap-core`, the
  model contract, and what `chap eval` actually computes.
- `26-08-23_b03_dataCharacterisation.md` — batch 3, phase A: pinning the Lao data, cutting
  off the held-out year, describing the development period, and fixing the backtest scheme.
- `26-08-23_b04_methodSurvey.md` — batch 4, phase A: running the reference model to get the
  score the project is measured against, and ranking the candidate model families against
  what the data will carry.
- `26-08-26_b05_bootstrapPlan.md` — batch 5, phase A: the claim-tree design, the fork
  inventory and the perturbation manifest, and the concrete batches for phases C, D and E.
- `26-08-26_b06_verticalSlice.md` — batch 6, phase B: the persistence baseline implemented
  against the Chap contract and run end to end on the development file, exercising every
  link in the chain once and giving the project its first CRPS from a model of its own.
- `26-08-26_b07_erectTheTree.md` — batch 7, phase B: the claim tree built from batch 5's
  design, the vertical slice routed through it and reproduced exactly, the seasonal
  climatology baseline and the reference model added as nodes, and the paired per-cell
  comparison that measures what the evaluation can and cannot resolve.
- `26-08-27_b08_candidateContract.md` — batch 8, phase C: the candidate subtree and its four
  configuration forks, the route model configuration takes into an `MLproject` model, the
  project seed's derivation into component seeds, and candidate 1 — a hierarchical
  negative-binomial GLM with the best point forecast in the project and the worst CRPS.

- `26-08-27_b09_candidateForks.md` — batch 9, phase C: every remaining child of candidate 1's
  forks built and run, two new forks for the structural choices batch 8 declined to make
  silently, three forks promoted by a rule committed before the combination it chose was run,
  and the finding that one-at-a-time fork effects do not add — three forks worth 4.632 CRPS
  separately delivered 2.402 together, and two of nine children reversed sign.

- `26-08-27_b21_greedyBranch.md` — batch 21, **on branch `greedy` only**: batch 9's promotion
  rule iterated to a fixpoint instead of applied once. Three rounds, 23.698 → 21.275 mean
  CRPS, past the reference model and past each of its repeats — and still half a standard
  error from it, so nothing the project concludes changes. The cost is paid in the record:
  the first fork the rule moved is the one under which the model stores no fitted object.
