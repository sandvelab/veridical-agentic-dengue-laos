# Provenance — the hierarchical report

The append-only record of each build. Everything else in this folder is generated and is
rebuilt by the command below; this file is not, and is never overwritten.

## The first build — 2026-08-31, batch 17

**What it establishes.** That a reported number can be descended to the values it is made
of, by clicking rather than by asking. The tree supplies the upper levels; below them sit
four more — the national mean each model is reported at, that mean by province, each
province by month, and the per-cell CRPS everything above is an average of — for each of
the 65 combinations that were scored, on both datasets.

**Reproducible, and checked by running it twice.** Two builds into different directories
are byte-identical, README included. The only inputs that move between builds are the
date and the commit, both of which are recorded on the page.

**Nothing here recomputes an aggregate.** Every figure shown is displayed from the file the
analysis wrote — `metrics_summary.csv` for the national level, `crps_by_location.csv` for
the province level, `metrics_cell.csv` for the values, `conclusion.json` for the
conclusion. A report that re-derived its own means could disagree with the analysis about a
number and look right doing it, which is the failure `AGENTS.md` §1 is about, arriving in
the thing that displays the results rather than in the thing that computes them. The one
consequence is that the report cannot show what the analysis did not store: there is no
per-split, per-province breakdown anywhere below the province page, because the aggregation
node does not write one. That is the diagnostics gap batch 22 opened and batches 14, 15 and
16 declined to close, seen from the other end.

**Which child of the weighting fork a combination was aggregated under is discovered, not
named** — the one child of `04_score/02_aggregate` with results under that combination.
That is the rule every downstream step in the tree already follows, and it is why the
case-weighted and population-weighted rows show their own weighting in the page's tag
rather than the main path's.

**Two things it deliberately does not list.** Paths the repository declines to version —
the virtual environment `uv` builds inside a model's contract directory, `__pycache__`,
chap-core's per-split `work/` — because they are not the analysis's material. Before that
filter, `c_ensemble`'s "Scripts" section was 6 117 files, of which 11 were the node's.
And combinations that appear in a manifest but produced no scores: the report shows what is
on disk, and `05_stability/results/run_status.csv` is where a row that did not run is
reported.

**Why the folder's own README is generated and this file is not.** A hand-kept description
of a generated folder goes stale silently, which is the failure the "never hand-edit"
rule exists to prevent, so the README is written by the build. A record of *how* the build
happened cannot be written by the build without becoming an assertion the build makes about
itself, so it is written here, appended to, and versioned — which is why `.gitignore` now
excludes the folder's contents rather than the folder.

alternatives-considered: linking each node's results as a flat file list, which is what the
report did through batch 16 and which stopped being readable at sixty-five combinations —
the reported analysis would have been one entry among sixty-four perturbations of itself;
grouping by combination, with `main` and its holdout twin open and the rest folded, is what
replaced it. Building the detail pages only for `main` and `main__holdout`, which would
have been a tenth of the pages and would have made the reported analysis the only one a
reader could descend, in a project whose whole finding is that the reported analysis is one
member of a distribution. Sharing one stylesheet instead of inlining the CSS in every page,
which would save about 1.8 MB of 18; rejected because a page that carries its own styling
still opens in twenty years if it is moved on its own, and storage is not a constraint here
(human-set, 2026-08-29).

agency: agent-autonomous. Rule 8 and the requirement that the levels run national → province
→ month down to the values are the plan's; how the tree and the stored files are turned into
those levels is this batch's.

## Rebuilt after the collection closed — 2026-08-31, batch 17

```

script:              unchanged
invocation:          unchanged
inputs:              Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md, which gained C39 after the
                     first build; the rest unchanged

The claim collection is an input to the report — each node page carries the claims resting
on it — so adding a claim after a build leaves the report a claim short. Rebuilt, and the
count on the node pages is now the 39 the collection holds. Recorded rather than folded into
the entry above, because the first build's commit is what its own README and index page
state, and overwriting that would make the page disagree with the record of it.

## Rebuilt after the human settled what a claim may say — 2026-08-31, batch 17

```

script:              unchanged
invocation:          unchanged
inputs:              Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md, in which C23 now states the
                     1.90 standard errors as well as the two figures it divides; the rest
                     unchanged

The node pages carry the collection, so a corrected claim is a stale report until it is
rebuilt. Nothing under `analysis/` moved and no page's structure changed.

## Rebuilt for the release, with the external check in it — 2026-09-05, batch 19

```
result:              AI-generated/hierarchical-report/   (69 combinations, 1 387 pages)

                     Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md — 47 claims

Batch 17 built this report over 65 scored combinations; batch 20 added four, and this build
covers **69**. The two new nodes appear in the tree half, and the four external combinations
descend to their per-cell scores like every other. Nothing about the report's structure
changed and the script is untouched — the report is a function of the tree, and the tree grew.

The build takes about three seconds and the output is gitignored apart from this file, so
the rebuild is not a decision anybody has to weigh. That is the property that makes Rule 8
cheap here: the report is never the thing that is out of date, because it is never the thing
that is stored.

## Committed as a dated snapshot — 2026-09-27, row 34

**Why the output is now committed.** The human, reading the public repository, followed
`README.md`'s pointer to `index.html` and found nothing: the report was gitignored, so the
entry point the README names did not exist for anyone who had not cloned and built. The
batch-19 section above argued that ignoring the output means "the report is never the thing
that is out of date, because it is never the thing that is stored". That holds for a reader
with a checkout and fails for one on the repository host, who is the reader Rule 10 is for.

**What replaces the guarantee.** Committing the output makes staleness possible, so each
build now says what it is a snapshot of: the first line of `index.html` and of the folder
README state the build date and the commit of the tree it was built from, the command that
regenerates it, and that a tree changed since that commit means rebuilding rather than
trusting the copy. The script change is to that text only; no page's structure or content
moved otherwise. The previous local build (2026-09-05, `922506b`) was stale against the
released head, which is the failure this now makes visible rather than silent.

**Checked before committing**: no occurrence of the home-directory path in any of the
1 461 files, no file over 2 MB, and no page left over from an earlier build.

alternatives-considered: rewording the README to say "build it first", which keeps the
repository free of derived files but leaves the host reader without the way in; publishing
the build on GitHub Pages or as a release asset, which would need a second place to keep in
step with the tree. The human chose committing it with a dated note.
