# Read this first

The first thing to read in a new session, human or agent. It says what *this particular*
project is. When it stops matching reality it is worse than nothing.

Then read `AGENTS.md` — the standing instructions, and the single source of truth for how
work is done here.

---

## The project

**Develop, as autonomously as the setup allows, a spatio-temporal model that forecasts
monthly dengue case counts across the provinces of Laos, and make it perform decently under
Chap's own standard evaluation — while producing the complete veridical record of how it
came about.** The data is `chap_LAO_admin1_monthly.csv` from
`github.com/dhis2/climate-health-data`: monthly reported dengue counts for the admin-1
provinces of Laos, 1998–2010, with rainfall, mean temperature, mean relative humidity and a
static population figure. The evaluation is Chap's own cross-validated backtest (`chap
eval`), run against a locally installed, version-pinned `chap-core`; the headline number is
**mean CRPS across regions and across test splits**, reported with calibration beside it.

Two things are produced at once and neither is subordinate to the other: a forecasting
model with a defensible score, and the record of every execution, environment, judgment call
and rejected alternative behind it, together with how far the conclusion survives them. The
second is the reason the first is being done — **a model that scores well but whose
development cannot be reconstructed is a failed run of this project.**

The article this record feeds is the worked case for
`Archive/case-source-material/reproAgenticAiManuscript.md`, whose *An illustrating case*
section is currently unwritten. The project also belongs to the TrustAgentic proposal
(`trustAgenticProposal.md`), which asks how far an agentic system gets on a real,
representative research problem, and where it fails.

## The article

- **Target venue**: ***PLoS Computational Biology*** (human-set, 2026-08-31). The manuscript
  this case serves updates Sandve et al., *PLoS Comput Biol* 9(10): e1003285 (2013), which
  is both the precedent and now the target.
- **Status**: analysis (phase A complete, batches 1–5; phase B complete, batches 6–7; phase C complete, batches 8–11; **phase D complete — batches 12, 13, 22, 14 and 15; **phase E complete** — batch 16 opened the holdout and ran the frozen set on it, batch 17 completed the claim collection and built the hierarchical report, batch 18 ran the clean-room and outsider checks and reported the plan's drift, batch 23 closed the provenance records' digest gap, batch 24 stopped the frozen phase-E set being rebuilt on every run, batch 25's clean-room run completed the development half and was stopped by batch 24's own freeze check, batch 26 made the development manifest's order and pairing recorded decisions rather than derivations, batch 27's run reached phase E and was stopped at the last script in the tree, batch 30 made the frozen development figure reported rather than re-asserted, batch 31's clean-room run reached the end: `analysis/run.sh` exited 0 from a clean checkout for the first time, batch 28 made the pool's independent reconstruction a property of the analysis rather than of the order it was run in — and reported the held-out year's, which the record had called impossible for five batches — batch 20 ran the external check: the reported model, unchanged, on Thailand and Vietnam, where the development-to-final-year drop replicates in both, and **batch 19 produced the case write-up, the reproducibility report and the release — scanned and assembled but not pushed, because its own outsider check found a defect the release would have shipped while claiming its checks supported it**). Thirty-one rows in the ledger — thirty batches plus row 29, which is not a batch but work that arrived outside `/do` and is recorded as `AGENTS.md` §8 requires — plus **batch 21 on the branch `greedy`** — a counterfactual that iterates batch 9's promotion rule to a fixpoint, is never merged, and produces no reported result; what it settled is in the plan's §4b. **Batch 18 added 23, 24 and 25** — the provenance records' script hashes, the frozen phase-E manifest's recomputation, and completing the clean-room run it could not finish — **batch 25 added 26 and 27**, the development manifest's own recomputation and the clean-room run it could not finish either, **batch 26 added 28**, the pool check's dependence on which combinations exist on disk, and **batch 27 added 30 and 31**, the frozen figure's re-assertion and the clean-room run it could not finish. **Batch 32 fixed the recorded premise batch 19's outsider check found contradicting the pool in forty committed files, and batch 33 pushed on 2026-09-07: the repository is public at `github.com/sandvelab/veridical-agentic-dengue-laos` — `main` and batch 21's unmerged `greedy` branch beside it, on a safety scan re-run at the commit that went out. Phase E is complete and no ledger row is open.** With 19 and 20 closed the ledger's listing and its running order agree again — they did not while 19 and 20 sat above the batches that ran before them, which is why the ledger's own header still says so — with batch 19's release last because it must not claim more than the checks support. **A batch's number is an identifier, not a position**: batch 22 was added between 13 and 14, batch 21 runs on a branch, and rows 19 and 20 sit above the batches that run before them. The ledger was executed top to bottom until the phase-E tail, where it no longer is — take the order from the line above, or from the ledger's own header, which says the same thing.
- **Manuscript**: `Human-AI-collaboration/manuscript/`
- **The plan being executed**:
  `Human-input/Plans for AI generation/26-08-22_dengueForecastingCase.md`. It carries the
  batch ledger; `/do` runs the next open batch and stops.

## Settings this project has fixed

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Project random seed | `20260822`. Every component seed derives from it. |
| Main environment | `environment/` — CPython 3.13.0 and `chap-core==2.1.0`, **installed from** `environment/lock.txt` by `environment/install-chap.sh`, which reports any difference between what it built and that file. Invoked as `environment/chapenv/bin/chap`. Not the same as `.venv`, which runs the repository's own machinery. The Docker layer builds (verified batch 7). |
| Repository machinery interpreter | `.venv/bin/python` — CPython 3.13.7, created 2026-08-23 with `python3 -m venv .venv` on macOS 26.6.2 (arm64). |
| Tracking level | **full** (`AGENTS.md` §6). This project is *about* tracking, so the usual argument for a lighter touch does not apply. Raise it with me rather than drifting. |
| Compute budget for stability work | Phase D is batches 12, 13, 22, 14, 15. The perturbation manifest is two tiers — every fork taken alone, then eight pairs selected by a rule fixed in advance — over **seventeen** forks, run on development and again on the holdout. Batch 12 wrote it: **24 tier-1 combinations, 8 tier-2 slots**, in `analysis/05_stability/results/manifest.csv`, committed before any of it ran. It was planned at 124 minutes on development and 75 on the holdout, against a **12-hour budget** the agent set so the cut order has something to be a cut against; nothing is cut and the cut order is recorded. **The whole development manifest has run and took 3.66 hours**, summed from `run_status.csv` over all 32 rows. Over the rows the manifest costed, planned and actual agree at 7 469 s — a ratio of **1.00** — with per-row ratios from 0.51 to 1.91, which is batch 13's finding confirmed a second time: the total is right and no individual row is, so the cut order those estimates rank carries no information. Compute is not what binds and it is not close — most of it is re-running the reference model, four unseeded repeats through an amd64 image under emulation, for the one model the plan forbids perturbing. **The phase-E half was frozen at an estimated 2.07 hours** (`analysis/05_stability/results/manifest_holdout.csv`) **and ran in 2.39, a ratio of 1.15** — the first estimates in this project that were predictions rather than measurements of runs that had already happened, and the worst row is again `retrain_everySplit` at 1.97 (`results/holdout_cost_planned_vs_actual.json`). |
| Stability, reported | **Phase D is done. The development set is 32 analyses and the result is a distribution, not a number** (`analysis/05_stability/results/distribution.json`). Reported skill spans **−0.0724 to +0.2320** around the main path's +0.1485, **which sits thirteenth of thirty-two**; our model beats the reference on **27 of 32** and both required baselines on 27, and the failures are structured — the five rows the reference wins are the five that replace our model or refit its weights, the five a baseline wins are the five that weight the mean by cases. 10–90 coverage runs **0.458 to 0.920** against a nominal 0.80. **Six of the seventeen forks move the conclusion further than the reference model moves on its own and eleven do not** (`results/sensitivity_by_fork.csv`), the yardstick being the **0.0218** spread of our skill score against the reference's four unseeded repeats — measured, not chosen. **That yardstick is itself a draw, and it has now been drawn four times: 0.0218, 0.0431, 0.0349, 0.0483, on which the same file reads six, three, three and three of seventeen.** The band is a max minus a min over four repeats of an unseeded model; the three forks that crossed it — training window, province filter, persistence construction — did not move, the band did. Only family, pool weighting and headline-mean weighting are clear of it on every draw. The human settled how this is reported on 2026-09-03: the count stands as the headline, stated together with the draw-dependence of the band it is measured against (plan §4b). Above it: family 0.2209, pool weighting 0.1820, headline-mean weighting 0.0835, province filter 0.0376, persistence construction 0.0279, training window 0.0219. Below it: eight of the nine candidate-internal forks phase C spent three batches on, which are eight of the eleven forks below the line. **The model family is what the conclusion is sensitive to and the choices inside a family are not** — swapping the pool for candidate 1 costs 0.2209 of skill, while the eight forks inside the two member families span 18.638 to 18.933 CRPS over the eleven combinations they perturb, about half the reference's own 0.57 re-run spread. The exception is the pool's own weighting fork, worth 0.1820 and the second-largest move. The scoring fork is worth 0.0835, the five `02_setup` forks at most 0.0376, the two baseline forks at most 0.0279. **Under case weighting a required baseline beats the reported model in every combination it appears in**, five rows of the 32. **And the forks do not compose**: tier 2's largest interaction, −0.1033, is bigger than either main effect behind it — the province filter and case weighting each improve the reported skill alone and almost exactly cancel together. **Phase E ran the same 32 on 2010** (`holdout_distribution.json`, `holdout_vs_development.json`): skill **−0.5038 to +0.2026** around +0.0868, which sits **eighteenth of thirty-two**; our model beats the reference on 26 and both baselines on 27; **28 of the 32 scored worse than on development**, median −0.056. **The ranking of the analyses barely transfers** — rank correlation **+0.396** — while the ranking of the forks transfers better at **+0.679**, with **14 of 17 agreeing** on whether they matter — a count that batch 31's clean-room run reproduced exactly while the forks mattering on *both* datasets went from four (`aggregate`, `family`, `provinces`, `trainingWindow`) to one (`family`), so it is reported with those names beside it and not on its own. But the order changes at the top: the **province filter goes from 0.0376 to 0.2696**, the largest fork effect in the project, the family halves to 0.0949, and the pool's weighting collapses to 0.0121 and falls below the band. **The row development ranked fourth (+0.1861), highest of every analysis that does not re-weight the mean, is twenty-ninth on 2010 (−0.1828), with its case-weighted pair worst of all at −0.5038**, and it is a fork that moves the *reference* — our pool goes 76.73 → 76.56 while the reference goes 84.03 → 64.72. |
| Storage budget | **Not a constraint.** A few gigabytes for the whole repository is fine (human-set, 2026-08-29, on batch 22's question). Nothing is pruned and no batch plans around disk; `/annotate-criticality` keeps annotating so that a future decision would be targeted. Measured now that both manifests have run: `analysis/` holds **18 GB**, of which **16 GB is `analysis/**/work/`** — chap-core's per-split run directories, gitignored since batch 7 and read by nothing after a run. What the repository tracks under `analysis/` is **1.6 GB** of `results/`. Still inside what the human called fine, and the holdout's rows are about half the size of their development twins because the backtest is four splits rather than eight. |
| Data governance | Public and redistributable. The Lao files are pinned by repository commit hash, copied into `Archive/` unmodified, marked `(IS_SHADOW)`, with `provenance.md`. Nothing here is access-restricted, so the release scan is about secrets, not permissions. |
| Target | `disease_cases` (reported dengue), monthly, admin-1, Laos. |
| What the metric is a mean over | **16 provinces, 371 cells** on development — not the 18 provinces in the file. Vientiane (LA-VI) reports nothing and is dropped by Chap's region filter; Xaisomboun (LA-XN) stops reporting after 2005 and contributes no evaluable cell. Established in batch 3. |
| Metric | Mean CRPS across regions × splits, produced by Chap's own evaluation. Secondary: interval coverage, MAE. |
| Reported conclusion | A skill score against the reference model, `1 − CRPS_ours / CRPS_ewars`, computed per analysis by a script, with raw CRPS and coverage beside it. Relative rather than absolute, so that the development and held-out spreads can be read on one axis instead of confounding inflated performance with a harder year. **+0.1485 on development and +0.0868 on the held-out year** (`analysis/results/main/conclusion.json`, `analysis/results/main__holdout/conclusion.json`): mean CRPS **18.817** against the reference's 22.098, ahead of both required baselines, ahead of each of the reference's four repeats individually, and better in six of the eight splits. The reported model is **candidate 3, the linear opinion pool**, promoted onto the main path in batch 11. It is also the most over-dispersed model in the project — 10–90 coverage 0.863 against nominal 0.80, 25–75 coverage 0.749 against 0.50 — and §2's rule that a badly calibrated CRPS winner has not won is why that is reported beside the score rather than under it. On 2010 that over-dispersion does not survive: 10–90 coverage is **0.755**. Beside the ratio, the raw figures on the holdout are **76.731 against the reference's 84.026** over 192 cells — 2010 is about four times the CRPS of the development period for every model in the comparison, which is what the ratio exists to control for. |
| External check | **Run, batch 20, 2026-09-04.** The reported model, unchanged, on the Thai and Vietnamese files of the same harmonisation (`Archive/sibling-datasets/`), cut onto the Lao calendar by `analysis/01_data/03_siblings` and run by `analysis/06_external` in the same two arrangements Laos is reported in, on the same months. Four rows, planned with their cost estimate against a six-hour budget before any of them ran; **planned 3.14 h, actual 1.81 h**, nothing cut. **The development-to-final-year drop replicates in both countries** — Thailand +0.0856 → +0.0197, Vietnam +0.0852 → **−0.0862**, against Laos's +0.1485 → +0.0868, every drop larger than the two reference bands together **on this draw, a clause the clean-room run of 2026-09-05 returned false for Laos and Thailand and which is therefore withdrawn as a general statement** — so 2010 alone does not account for the drop phase E measured, and what survives a re-run is the direction, the ordering and the sign of the Vietnamese loss rather than their size against the reference's own noise. **Six of six beat both required baselines and five of six the reference**, the exception being Vietnam's final year. **The country the model was developed on is the one it scores highest on**, by 0.063, while the two it never saw agree with each other to 0.0004. Over-dispersion is worse abroad: 10–90 coverage 0.941 and 0.967 on the sibling development backtests against 0.863 on Laos's. And the reference model's own re-run spread is **0.032 CRPS on Thailand, 0.565 on Laos and 7.082 on Vietnam** — a factor of 219 — which is why the two noise-floor rows below now name their dataset. The pool's independent reconstruction is not available on these datasets and that is recorded, with what it would have cost: no fork moves, so no member is evaluated on its own. (`analysis/06_external/results/external_vs_laos.json`) |
| Required baselines | Persistence and seasonal climatology, implemented as Chap-compatible models so they traverse the identical evaluation path. Each has a fork on how it is constructed, and batch 22 ran both: the persistence fork is worth **4.181 CRPS** — the second published construction scores 20.698 and **beats the reference model** — and the climatology window fork 0.532, inside the noise floor. The reported analysis takes the worse persistence construction, and the pool is better off for it. |
| Reference model to beat | `https://github.com/chap-models/chapkit_ewars_model` (WHO EWARS-csd), at its own default configuration — on the cross-validated development backtest **and** on the held-out year. Not tuned by us. Pinned by image digest `sha256:abd8098f…` (= source commit `a4c2fa42`); runs as an amd64 chapkit service under emulation, so **Docker must be running**. Its development mean CRPS is **22.098**, the per-cell mean of four repeats scored from inside the tree in batch 7 (batch 4's reconnaissance figure was 21.9). It is **unseeded**: on the development backtest the four repeats span 21.820 to 22.385, so a margin under **~0.57 CRPS** against it there means nothing. **That figure is a property of this dataset and not of the model**: batch 20 measured the same spread on the sibling countries at **0.032 CRPS on Thailand's development backtest and 7.082 on Vietnam's**, a factor of 219, so the floor is quoted with the dataset it was measured on or not at all. |
| Project seed, derived | Every component seed is `int(blake2b("<project seed>:<component>", digest_size=8), 16) % 2**32`, computed by `analysis/scripts/lib/project_seed.py`, which reads the project seed from the table above rather than carrying a copy. Fixed in batch 8, the first batch with anything to seed. |
| What counts as success | Beating both baselines and EWARS. Nothing here can reach statistical significance and no attempt is made to suggest it does: the comparison is reported with its per-region and per-split spread and a plain statement of what that spread can distinguish. "We cannot separate these two" is a conclusion. **The backtest's resolution is a property of the pair being compared, not of the dataset** — batch 7 measured about 4 CRPS using the baselines; batch 8's candidate cleared two standard errors; batch 9's candidate is **1.03 standard errors** from the reference, which is the "cannot separate" case arriving in practice; batch 10's candidate 2 is **1.20 standard errors on the other side** of it, which is the same case with the sign reversed; batch 11's pool is **1.90 standard errors** on that side, which is the largest margin the project has and still short of separating the two. Nothing below **0.57 CRPS** can be attributed to a model at all **on the Lao development backtest**, which is the reference's own re-run spread there. **The qualification is not decoration**: batch 20 ran the same measurement on two sibling countries and got 0.032 CRPS on Thailand's development backtest and 7.082 on Vietnam's — and on Vietnam our own +0.0852 margin falls inside it, so on that dataset the comparison this project is built on cannot be made. A resolution quoted without its dataset is the kind of statement this project exists not to make. |
| Shape of the reported result | A **spread, not a point**, on both datasets, and both are now reported. Development runs **−0.0724 to +0.2320**; the holdout runs **−0.5038 to +0.2026**, a range of 0.706 against 0.304 — **more than twice as wide**. The set was frozen before the year was opened, so the second spread is a measurement rather than a selection. |
| Model service framework | `chapkit` may be used to build our own models against the Chap contract. Permitted, not mandated. |
| Development data | 1998-01 to 2009-12. The only file development ever sees. |
| Held-out data | 2010-01 to 2010-12. **Opened once, in batch 16**, and evaluated across the manifest frozen in batch 15. The file phase E reads is `analysis/01_data/01_partition/results/phase_e_1998-01_2010-12.csv`, written by `open_holdout.py` from the two parts beside it and byte-identical to the archived source; which of the two files a combination reads is decided by the `__holdout` suffix, in `analysis/scripts/lib/combos.py` and nowhere else. |
| Backtest scheme (`n-periods`, `n-splits`, `stride`) | **Development: 3, 8, 3** (`n-retrain` 1) — evaluates 2008-01 to 2009-12 from a training set ending 2007-12. **Phase E: 3, 4, 3** on the full file — evaluates exactly 2010. Fixed in batch 3; it does not move, because a horizon changed midway makes every earlier number incomparable. Verified against chap-core's own splitter in `analysis/01_data/02_characterise/results/split_schedule.csv`. |
| Git remote | **`github.com/sandvelab/veridical-agentic-dengue-laos`** (human-set, 2026-08-31, reversing the earlier position that none was to be created). **Created public and pushed on 2026-09-07, batch 33** — `main` at `8690d0a` and batch 21's unmerged `greedy` at `6bfeecf` — as the last step of the release, after the secrets and data-permission scan, `/validate cleanroom`, `/validate outsider` and both generated reports, because a release that pushes before its own scan has not run its scan. The scan was re-run once more on the commit actually pushed, the earlier pair having read a tree without the licence files. The agent asked before the push. Feasible as measured, and remeasured on 2026-09-05 because both figures had grown: `.git` is **189 MB** and the largest tracked file is **41.8 MB**, one of the external check's Thai NetCDF evaluations — Thailand carries 76 provinces against Laos's 16. Inside GitHub's 50 MB advisory threshold and well inside its 100 MB limit. The working tree is 2.6 GB. |

## What must not happen

These override everything else here.

1. **The final year is removed from the data before any work begins, and opened once.**
   2010 is cut off into a separate holdout file; development, tuning, selection and the whole
   backtest happen on 1998-01 to 2009-12 and nothing is pointed at anything else until the
   final validation. The holdout's case values are not read, plotted, characterised or
   reasoned about during development. If the holdout is opened a second time, that it happened
   and why is recorded. It is opened once but *evaluated* many times — across the frozen
   perturbation manifest — and that is only honest because the manifest was fixed beforehand:
   **nothing is added, dropped, re-tuned or re-run after a holdout number has been seen.**
   That binds `manifest_holdout.csv` and nothing else: the tree and the development manifest
   may still grow, since `/validate invariants` requires every non-main child to have a
   development row, and a row added after the opening simply has no holdout twin and never
   joins the 32 (plan §3, clarified 2026-09-01). **Nothing further is added in this project**
   — the set stays at 32, human-set 2026-09-01.
   **This has happened: batch 16 opened it, on 2026-08-31, and ran exactly the set frozen in
   batch 15.** The driver enforces the second half, on **two conditions and needing both**:
   the row is recorded as `ran` in `05_stability/results/run_status_holdout.csv`, which is
   versioned, so re-running one means deleting its row and that shows in git; and
   `05_stability/.holdout_opened`, which is gitignored, says that *this working
   tree* is the one that opened the year. **Batch 18's clean-room check found that the
   versioned condition alone sealed every clone of the repository too**, so all thirty-two
   rows were skipped in a fresh checkout and the phase-E half of `analysis/run.sh`
   reproduced its outputs without running the analysis behind them.
2. **No number reaches a claim except through a file.** `chap eval` writes NetCDF, `chap
   export-metrics` writes CSV; every reported figure is read from one of those by a script,
   never from terminal output. (`AGENTS.md` §1.)
3. **Every judgment call is an alternatives node or a logged decision, never silent** — and
   carries its agency: `human-set`, `agent-on-human-assessment`, `agent-autonomous`; for
   information gathering, `agent-retrieved` or `human-pointed`.
4. **Failures are kept.** Models that did not work, installs that did not build, approaches
   abandoned: they stay in the record with what went wrong.
5. **Chap runs locally, from a pinned version** — not against a hosted service. If a local
   install proves genuinely impossible, stop and report rather than switching.

## Left to the human, not to the agent

Anything that spends real money; abandoning the local Chap install for a hosted service; any
change to the success criterion or to the five points above. **Creating the remote is no
longer open** — it was settled on 2026-08-31, owner and name both, the agent asked before the
push itself, and the push happened on 2026-09-07. **What is still the human's here is the
citable snapshot with a persistent identifier** that `/release` asks for: linking the
repository to Zenodo or an equivalent, tagging a release and citing the DOI in the manuscript
needs an account the agent does not have, and it is the one step of Rule 10 the push does not
complete. The success criterion was settled on 2026-08-23 and is now fixed — including what to
do if EWARS cannot be run on this dataset, which the plan's §2 answers.

Two things that were open and are not: **the case write-up's judgment about where this
setup was more trouble than it was worth is the agent's**, offered back for comment
afterwards, and batch 19 labels it `agent-autonomous` rather than jointly held; and
**`analysis/run.sh` is not split**, so it reproduces both distributions and the clean-room
check in batch 18 is a six-hour run. Both human-set, 2026-08-31, on batch 16's questions.

## Where things are

- The analysis is a tree of questions under `analysis/`. Start at
  `AI-generated/hierarchical-report/index.html`, or `/node tree`. **Batch 17 built that
  report** and batch 19 rebuilt it over the external check's four rows: **1 387 pages** and
  **69 combinations**, the tree above and four levels below it — the national mean each
  model was scored at, that mean by province, each province month by month, and the
  per-cell scores everything above is an average of, for each combination that was scored. Every number on it is displayed from the file the analysis wrote. It is
  rebuilt in a few seconds by `/hierarchical-report` and **committed as a dated snapshot**
  since 2026-09-27 (row 34) — gitignored before that, which left the README pointing a
  reader on GitHub at a file that was not there; `index.html` and the folder README say
  the date and commit each build was made from. Its full design — every node,
  every fork, the file contract between them, and the `COMBO` mechanism that lets one code path
  serve both the main analysis and the stability run — is in
  `AI-generated/batch-reports/26-08-26_b05_bootstrapPlan.md`. **Batch 7 built it**, and
  `bash analysis/run.sh` reproduces the whole reported analysis **and the distribution around
  it**: batch 15 put the perturbation driver into `05_stability/run.sh` and batch 16 the
  phase-E half after it, so the run is about six hours rather than the twenty minutes it was
  through batch 14. Most of the difference is the reference model's four unseeded repeats
  through an amd64 image under emulation, now on two datasets.
  `analysis/README.md` is the map. Every node below `01_data` reads and writes under
  `results/$COMBO/`, which defaults to `main`. **Batch 8 added `03_models/03_candidate`**,
  our own model families: `a_hierNB` and the four forks that configure it. Its
  configuration reaches the model as a file assembled from those forks and passed to
  `chap eval --model-configuration-yaml`, which is also where the component seed enters.
  **Batch 9 built every remaining child of those forks and added two more forks** —
  `05_autoregressive` and `06_yearVariance` — ran all nine alternatives on development, and
  promoted three of them onto the main path. The candidate now beats both required baselines
  and is 1.03 standard errors from the reference. A second environment variable,
  `COMBO_BASE`, lets a combination inherit what it did not move; `analysis/run.sh` sets
  none, so the reported analysis inherits nothing.
  **Batch 10 added `03_models/03_candidate/b_boosted`** — candidate 2, gradient-boosted trees
  with a probabilistic head — and its two forks, `01_features` and `02_head`. It scores
  **20.771** on development. The model brings **scikit-learn** into a
  model environment for the first time, pinned by the `uv.lock` beside it, and stores its
  fitted ensembles as JSON the project's own code can walk without scikit-learn installed.
  **Batch 12 added `05_stability`** — the perturbation manifest and the driver — and, with
  it, the **nine fork children the tree had named in prose and never carried**: the second
  child of each `02_setup` fork, both children of the scoring fork, and the second child of
  each baseline fork. They are nodes with claims and no scripts; batches 13 and 22 wrote
  them, and **every child the tree names is now a path the tree carries**. The manifest is computed from the tree by `scripts/lib/inventory.py`, so it counts
  **seventeen forks** where batch 5's hand-written list counted ten, and
  `/validate invariants` gained a **`combos`** check that fails when the manifest and the
  tree disagree, or when a `results/` directory holds a combination nobody planned. **Batch
  11's promotion changed what two of the forks reach**: the pool takes both required
  baselines as members, so a fork on how persistence wraps its uncertainty now moves our
  reported model as well as the persistence row. The driver, `run_manifest.py`, is written
  and deliberately **not** in `run.sh` until batch 15; the two defects that held fourteen
  built rows are fixed and those rows have run.
  **Batch 23 added a `hashes` check**: for every file a provenance record gives a sha256 for,
  the record must name that file's *current* digest somewhere. It found **twenty stale
  records** where batch 18 had estimated sixteen — the four it adds all name the shared
  evaluation library `chap_eval.py` on a continuation line, and it changed twice after they
  were written, so a check reading only `script:` lines passed all four. Nineteen of the
  twenty are one failure repeated: a batch appended its section when it ran the script,
  changed the script again later in the same batch, and did not append again. The worst was
  the record of the headline result, which named a version of `conclude.py` that had not
  existed since batch 16 ran it thirty-two times to produce phase E's conclusions.
  **Batch 24 stopped the frozen phase-E set being rebuilt.**
  `freeze_holdout_manifest.py` is the last step of the development half of
  `05_stability/run.sh`, so every run of `analysis/run.sh` re-derived the frozen manifest
  from the development one — which may legitimately grow. It came back byte-identical
  because the tree had not changed, and batch 18 added one fork child and got **34 rows**.
  The file is now authoritative: the script verifies it into
  `results/holdout_freeze_check.json` and writes nothing to it, a development row with no
  frozen twin is reported unpaired rather than added, and once the year has been opened the
  set is restored from git rather than re-derived. `/validate invariants` gains a **`freeze`**
  check, which also tests the claim `holdout_freeze.json` makes about its own commit — that no
  holdout result exists at the commit that added the frozen set. Eleven situations were put to
  the two of them (`AI-generated/validation/26-09-01_freezeDefence.md`); against the superseded
  script six of seven fail and every one exits 0. A second field was being overwritten by every
  run and nobody had noticed: `frozen_on`, one line above the field batch 16 repaired.
  **Batch 32 added `03_models/scripts/lib/pool_shape.py` and an eleventh invariant.** What
  the pool contains is now decided in one place, called by both the weighting child that
  registers it and the step that builds the pool from it; the two had computed it separately
  and disagreed from batch 22 onward, the specification saying **six members at 1/6 with
  two-thirds of the mass on the required baselines** where **four at 1/4** ran, in 40 of 47
  combinations. Ninety-four documents were rewritten by re-running the tree's own two steps —
  the 47 `model_option_spec.json` and the 47 `candidate_spec.json` that embed one — and **all
  47 `model_configuration.yaml` came back byte-identical**, so `configuration_sha256` never
  moved and no model was evaluated again. `/validate invariants` gains a **`pool`** check in
  three clauses, and `prepare_members.py` refuses to build a pool whose registered premise
  names other members before it writes anything. Six situations were put to the two of them
  (`AI-generated/validation/26-09-06_premiseDefence.json`), the first driven by the clean-room
  run's own log, which printed the wrong count and the right one three lines apart.
  **Batch 16 opened the holdout and ran the frozen set on it.** `01_data/01_partition`
  gained `open_holdout.py`, which reassembles the archived file from the two parts beside it
  and verifies the result byte for byte, so the node that was the only one licensed to read
  the whole record is still the only one that does. Which of the two files a combination
  reads, which backtest scheme it runs under and which span its province and training-window
  forks call "evaluated" are all decided by the `__holdout` suffix, in
  `analysis/scripts/lib/combos.py` and nowhere else — six setup scripts and `conclude.py`
  read it rather than carrying a copy. `run_manifest.py --dataset holdout` runs the set; its
  one different row is the main path, which on development runs `conclude.py` alone and here
  runs the whole pipeline. The phase-E half of `05_stability/run.sh` follows it, so
  `analysis/run.sh` is now about six hours and reproduces both distributions.
  **Batch 15 reported the distribution and froze the phase-E set**: `distribution.json`,
  `distribution_rows.csv`, `sensitivity_by_fork.csv` and three figures at `05_stability`,
  the driver added to `run.sh` after checking that re-planning returns the frozen manifest
  byte-identical, `manifest_holdout.csv` with each row's development conclusion frozen
  beside it, and the `combos` invariant extended to read both manifests. The first twelve
  claims are in `Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md`.
  **Batch 14 ran them and tier 2, and fixed four things**: `prepare_members.py` ran every
  member fork's main-path child where the combination had already moved one; `conclude.py`
  read our reported model off `claim.md` rather than off the results, so every family row
  would have said `candidate_exists: false`; `03_compare` computed its paired spread
  unweighted beside a leaderboard that followed the weighting fork, so the two weighting rows
  had been carrying the main path's own spread under a re-weighted mean; and the driver
  called a family's `run.sh` after the moved child, which re-runs that fork's sibling when
  the fork belongs to the family that is running. **All four are the same fork-blindness** —
  a step that discovers something from the tree, written when every fork had one child that
  did anything. Batch 14 called itself the last count of it and was wrong twice over: batch
  22 found two more and **batch 32 a fifth**, so the family runs to five and the batch that
  declared it closed is part of the record of why that kind of declaration is worth little. The batch also carried
  out the **assembler lift** batches 10 and 11 both logged and deferred to whichever batch
  re-ran the combinations those scripts configured: `03_models/scripts/lib/assemble_config.py`
  is now the one way a candidate family's configuration is assembled, and the three families
  are one-screen runners.
  **Batch 22 added the two baseline forks' children** — the parametric persistence
  construction and the frozen-window climatology, each its own Chap contract directory. It
  found and fixed two more fork-blind globs, neither reachable until a fork had two built
  children: `prepare_members.py` would have made the reported pool a **six-member pool with
  two persistence baselines and two climatologies**, silently, under `main`; and `01_collect`
  inherited from `COMBO_BASE` per node rather than per fork, which would have put both
  constructions on one leaderboard. Both leave every existing result byte-identical.
  **It fixed one of two globs that read the tree the same way and left the other**: the
  weighting child's `choose_weighting.py` counted contract directories to say what the pool
  would contain, and went on saying six for ten days. That is batch 32.
  **Batch 11 added `03_models/03_candidate/c_ensemble`** — candidate 3, a linear opinion pool
  over the two candidate families and both required baselines — with one fork, `01_weighting`.
  It scores **18.817** and **the family fork was promoted to it**, so `analysis/run.sh` now
  reproduces the pool and the two demoted families run under `family_hierNB` and
  `family_boosted`. The pool holds no member code: each member runs through **its own Chap
  entry points**, read out of the member's own `MLproject`, and its configuration is assembled
  under the running combination by that family's own scripts — so a phase-D perturbation of a
  member's fork moves the pool's member with it. Its sibling fork child, which fits the weights
  by minimising the pool's CRPS on a year held back inside the training frame, is **4.021 CRPS
  worse**, and that is the batch's most useful result rather than a footnote.
- **The external check is at `analysis/06_external`**, with the sibling data it runs on cut
  and characterised at `analysis/01_data/03_siblings` — between them, that node and
  `01_partition` are the only nodes that read anything under `Archive/`. Four rows, run
  through the same driver the perturbation set runs through
  (`05_stability/scripts/lib/driver.py`, which moved to a library in batch 20 when a second
  caller appeared), with no fork moved in any of them: the four sibling datasets are dataset
  suffixes on the mechanism `__holdout` already uses, in `analysis/scripts/lib/combos.py`.
  Nothing there is sealed, because nothing was developed on those files, and no row is
  skipped on a second invocation — the reason phase E's rows are is a seal, and a seal
  protecting nothing would only stop `analysis/run.sh` reproducing the check.
- Batch reports, one per executed batch, are in `AI-generated/batch-reports/`. Checks on the
  method — clean-room, determinism — are in `AI-generated/validation/` and
  `AI-generated/determinism-checks/`. What every alternative to a candidate's configuration
  scores, and the rules by which forks and families are promoted, are in
  `AI-generated/candidate-forks/` — two rounds for candidate 1, `boosted_round1/` for
  candidate 2 and `ensemble_round1/` for candidate 3, whose forks all stayed put, plus
  `families/` and `family_rule.md`, which are what the family fork was moved on. The numbers there are copied from files
  inside the tree, and it is a phase-C selection aid rather than the phase-D stability
  result.
- The vertical slice that preceded the tree is in `AI-generated/vertical-slice/`. Its numbers
  are **not** reported results; the tree reproduces them exactly, and the persistence model
  itself now lives at `analysis/03_models/01_baselines/01_persistence/a_empiricalChange/`.
- What the reference model and the rest of Chap's model library can do on *this* dataset — the
  reference's score, cost and repeatability, and an inventory of the 39 `chap-models`
  repositories — is in `AI-generated/method-reconnaissance/`, rebuilt by
  `AI-internal/reconnaissance/`. Those numbers establish the criterion; they are not yet
  results of this project.
- What the Chap platform is and does — the CLI surface, the model contract, and one worked
  `chap eval` on an unrelated example dataset — is captured in
  `AI-generated/chap-reconnaissance/`, rebuilt by `AI-internal/reconnaissance/`. None of
  those numbers is a result of this project.
- Source material — the manuscript, the 2013 rules, the proposal and its supplement, and the
  Chap orientation note — is in `Archive/case-source-material/`.
- The annual national population series the population fork back-casts from is in
  `Archive/lao-population/`, fetched from the World Bank by
  `AI-internal/data-acquisition/fetch_lao_population.sh`. Batch 13 established from it that
  **the dataset's population column does not have the level its schema claims**: it sums to
  4.96 M against a stated 2020 reference whose national total was 7.35 M, matching the country
  around 1995. That is the third statement in that schema found not to describe the file.
- The sibling datasets the external check runs on are in `Archive/sibling-datasets/`, at the
  same commit, fetched by `AI-internal/data-acquisition/fetch_sibling_datasets.sh`. One pin
  for all three countries, so a difference between countries is not also a difference between
  harmonisations. Reading them established that **two of the three statements the Lao schema
  makes that do not describe the Lao file describe none of the three**: `rainfall` is a mean
  daily rate in all three despite being declared a monthly total, and `row_count` counts
  complete records in two files and rows in the third. Thailand's `population` is also not a
  static snapshot — it ships the annual series the Lao `b_backCast` fork had to reconstruct.
- The data is in `Archive/lao-dataset/`, at commit `af362d52` of `dhis2/climate-health-data`,
  with a checksum manifest that `analysis/01_data/01_partition` re-verifies on every run. That
  node is the only one licensed to read the full file; everything else reads the development
  file it writes. `AI-internal/data-acquisition/` holds the fetch script.
- The plan **as it was delivered**, before any of it had been run, is in
  `Archive/plan-as-delivered/`. The live plan is edited as the project runs; how far the two
  have drifted, and who drove each change, is a reported result rather than bookkeeping. The
  plan's §4b logs each decision settled during execution, with its agency.
- Everything the analysis supports is in `Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md` — **47 claims**; batch 20 added six, which are the external check's — the drop replicating in two more countries, the country the model was developed on scoring highest, what the backtest can resolve being a property of the country, the over-dispersion travelling, two of the three schema errors being the harmonisation's rather than Laos's, and the cost model's total being wrong in the one place it was tested against a dataset it had not been measured on; batch 28 added the two that are not phase A–E's own: the pool rebuilt independently on the held-out year, and how much of the perturbation set that second path can reach. Batch 15 wrote the first twelve, all of them phase D's; batch 16 added nine, all of them phase E's; and **batch 17 added eighteen**, which are the phase-A, -B and -C half the file had been missing — the development headline and what its margin cannot separate, the reference model's own re-run floor, what pooling bought and what fitting its weights cost, the family that never beat the reference, three statements in the dataset's schema that do not describe the file, and the determinism of every model we wrote. **A claim may state what follows trivially from the figures it cites — a ratio, a ranking — and may not state anything that needed a step nobody ran** (human-set, 2026-08-31, settling batch 17's question). So the paired margin is reported as 3.282 CRPS against a split-clustered standard error of 1.726 *and* as the 1.90 standard errors that quotient makes it.
- Nothing enters the manuscript that is not in that file.

## How to work here

- **Bring source material in**: place it in `Archive/`, marked `(IS_SHADOW)` on line 2,
  with a `provenance.md` beside it. Never edit it in place.
- **Add a question to the analysis**: `/node new <parent> <name> --claim "<claim>"`.
- **After any analysis run**: `/track-result`, `/commit-run after`, `/validate invariants`.
- **When something is worth saying**: `/claims add`.
- **Before release**: `/validate cleanroom`, `/validate outsider`, `/hierarchical-report`,
  `/repro-report`, `/release`.

## What has to stay true

1. `analysis/run.sh` reproduces the reported analysis from a clean environment — and, since
   batch 15, the whole perturbation set with it, and since batch 16 the same set on the
   held-out year. **As of batch 31 this is verified end to end: `analysis/run.sh` exited 0
   from a clean checkout**, both datasets, all 64 combinations, both distributions and the
   last script in the tree, in 41 677 s on a host held awake. It took four attempts and each
   was stopped one step further down than the last — batch 18 by its session at 8 of 32 rows,
   batch 25 by a recorded *selection* being re-derived at the freeze check, batch 27 by a
   recorded *figure* being re-asserted at the last script — and batches 26 and 30 fixed the
   second and third. All three checks held on batch 31's run, each against a fresh draw that
   disagreed with the record. See `AI-generated/validation/26-09-04_cleanroom.md`.
   **What is verified**: every model this project wrote returned an identical CRPS in every
   combination it appears in, on **both** halves — 192 model-combination scores, none moved —
   and the phase-E counts reproduce exactly (26 of 32 beat the reference, 27 of 32 both
   baselines, rank 18 of 32). **What is not**: the reference model is an unseeded container,
   so every figure dividing by it is a draw, and this run drew a different one. So
   **`analysis/run.sh` reproduces this analysis from nothing, and that claim carries the
   qualification in the same breath** — our models are bit-identical, the reference is not.
   **One reported figure reproduced while what it counts did not**: `14 of 17 forks agree on
   whether the fork matters` came back identical, while the forks mattering on both datasets
   went from four (`aggregate`, `family`, `provinces`, `trainingWindow`) to one (`family`).
   Every check here compares values, so every one of them calls that field reproduced. Batch
   19 reports such agreement by identity and not only by count.
   **What that run did not cover, and what covered it.** `analysis/06_external` was added
   afterwards, in batch 20, so the external check's four rows were outside batch 31's run.
   **Batch 19 ran `/validate cleanroom` again with that node in the tree** — 14.87 h, exit 0,
   **207 of 207 scores from models this project wrote came back identical** — which settles it
   and, in the same run, withdrew batch 20's clause that all three development-to-final-year
   drops clear the two reference bands.
   **What has changed since that run.** Batch 32 rewrote **94 committed documents** — the
   weighting specifications and the assembled specifications that embed them. Nothing computed
   moved: all 47 `model_configuration.yaml` are byte-identical and a second pass reproduced
   102 documents byte for byte, so the rewritten files are deterministic functions of the
   checkout. Whether to spend another full run before the push was nonetheless a live
   question, and the human settled it on 2026-09-06: **no** — a further 15 hours would confirm
   deterministic functions of the checkout and nothing else, so **the release rests on the
   clean-room run of 2026-09-05 and says so**, rather than implying a check of the pushed
   commit. The project's own standard is that a release must not claim more than its checks
   support, and naming the run it rests on is how that standard is met here.
   **Batch 28 closed the one thing that run left open.** `check_pool.py`'s member matching
   depended on which combinations existed on disk — 13 `pool_check.json` files came back
   changed from the clean checkout, `main` among them. It is now a rule over the combination
   names, settled for every pool row by the last step of `05_stability/run.sh`, which is the
   first point in a run at which a member's own separate evaluation exists. All 51 files were
   rewritten and **no number that existed before moved**; four gained the reconstruction they
   had been run too early to have, the held-out headline row among them, at **76.646 rebuilt
   against 76.731 as run**.
2. Every reported result traces to a file that was executed.
3. Every sentence in the manuscript traces to a claim, to a result, to a command.
4. The alternatives not taken are still in the tree, runnable.
5. `/validate invariants` passes, because it was satisfied rather than weakened.
6. This file describes the project as it actually is.
