# Read this first

The first thing to read in a new session, human or agent. It says what *this particular*
project is. When it stops matching reality it is worse than nothing.

Then read `AGENTS.md` — the standing instructions, and the single source of truth for how
work is done here.

## You are on the branch `greedy`, which is not the project

**This checkout is branch `greedy`. It is a counterfactual, it is never merged, and nothing
in it is a reported result.** The project's analysis is on `main`, where batch 9's promotion
rule is applied once and the candidate scores **23.698** mean CRPS, a skill score of −0.072
against the reference. Here the same rule is iterated to a fixpoint — batch 21, at the
human's request — and the candidate scores **21.275**, a skill score of **+0.037**, which is
ahead of the reference model and still half a standard error from it.

Everything below describes the project as it is on `main`, except the items marked
*(branch)*. Read `AI-generated/batch-reports/26-08-27_b21_greedyBranch.md` for what this
branch is and what it found.

**Do not develop the project here.** Work on `main`; this branch exists to be read.

## The project

**Develop, as autonomously as the setup allows, a spatio-temporal model that forecasts
monthly dengue case counts across the provinces of Laos, and make it perform decently under
Chap's own standard evaluation — while producing the complete veridical record of how it
came about.** The data is `chap_LAO_admin1_monthly.csv` from
`github.com/dhis2/climate-health-data`: monthly reported dengue counts for the admin-1
provinces of Laos, 1998–2010, with rainfall, mean temperature, mean relative humidity and a
static population figure. The evaluation is Chap's own cross-validated backtest (`chap
eval`), run against a locally installed, version-pinned `chap-core`; the headline number is
**mean CRPS across regions and across test splits**, reported with calibration beside it.

Two things are produced at once and neither is subordinate to the other: a forecasting
model with a defensible score, and the record of every execution, environment, judgment call
and rejected alternative behind it, together with how far the conclusion survives them. The
second is the reason the first is being done — **a model that scores well but whose
development cannot be reconstructed is a failed run of this project.**

The article this record feeds is the worked case for
`Archive/case-source-material/reproAgenticAiManuscript.md`, whose *An illustrating case*
section is currently unwritten. The project also belongs to the TrustAgentic proposal
(`trustAgenticProposal.md`), which asks how far an agentic system gets on a real,
representative research problem, and where it fails.

## The article

- **Target venue**: not fixed in the source material. The manuscript this case serves updates
  Sandve et al., *PLoS Comput Biol* 9(10): e1003285 (2013), which is the obvious precedent.
- **Status**: analysis (phase A complete, batches 1–5; phase B complete, batches 6–7; **phase C under way, batches 8–9 done**, batch 10 next). Nineteen batches in the ledger, plus one optional, plus batch 21 *(branch)* — the counterfactual that lives only here.
- **Manuscript**: `Human-AI-collaboration/manuscript/`
- **The plan being executed**:
  `Human-input/Plans for AI generation/26-08-22_dengueForecastingCase.md`. It carries the
  batch ledger; `/do` runs the next open batch and stops.

## Settings this project has fixed

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Project random seed | `20260822`. Every component seed derives from it. |
| Main environment | `environment/` — CPython 3.13.0 and `chap-core==2.1.0`, **installed from** `environment/lock.txt` by `environment/install-chap.sh`, which reports any difference between what it built and that file. Invoked as `environment/chapenv/bin/chap`. Not the same as `.venv`, which runs the repository's own machinery. The Docker layer builds (verified batch 7). |
| Repository machinery interpreter | `.venv/bin/python` — CPython 3.13.7, created 2026-08-23 with `python3 -m venv .venv` on macOS 26.6.2 (arm64). |
| Tracking level | **full** (`AGENTS.md` §6). This project is *about* tracking, so the usual argument for a lighter touch does not apply. Raise it with me rather than drifting. |
| Compute budget for stability work | Phase D is batches 12–15. The perturbation manifest is two tiers — every fork taken alone, then eight pairs selected by a rule fixed in advance — over ten forks, run on development and again on the holdout. `/perturb` costs each perturbation, ranks by expected informativeness, cuts at the line and **records where the line fell and what was below it**; tier 2 is what gets cut first. Compute is not what binds: a full backtest costs one to three minutes. |
| Data governance | Public and redistributable. The Lao files are pinned by repository commit hash, copied into `Archive/` unmodified, marked `(IS_SHADOW)`, with `provenance.md`. Nothing here is access-restricted, so the release scan is about secrets, not permissions. |
| Target | `disease_cases` (reported dengue), monthly, admin-1, Laos. |
| What the metric is a mean over | **16 provinces, 371 cells** on development — not the 18 provinces in the file. Vientiane (LA-VI) reports nothing and is dropped by Chap's region filter; Xaisomboun (LA-XN) stops reporting after 2005 and contributes no evaluable cell. Established in batch 3. |
| Metric | Mean CRPS across regions × splits, produced by Chap's own evaluation. Secondary: interval coverage, MAE. |
| Reported conclusion | A skill score against the reference model, `1 − CRPS_ours / CRPS_ewars`, computed per analysis by a script, with raw CRPS and coverage beside it. Relative rather than absolute, so that the development and held-out spreads can be read on one axis instead of confounding inflated performance with a harder year. **On `main`: −0.072** — mean CRPS 23.698 against the reference's 22.098, ahead of both required baselines. ***(branch)*** `analysis/results/main/conclusion.json` in **this** checkout says **+0.037**, mean CRPS 21.275, because the greedy branch's candidate is a different model. It is not a reported result. |
| Required baselines | Persistence and seasonal climatology, implemented as Chap-compatible models so they traverse the identical evaluation path. |
| Reference model to beat | `https://github.com/chap-models/chapkit_ewars_model` (WHO EWARS-csd), at its own default configuration — on the cross-validated development backtest **and** on the held-out year. Not tuned by us. Pinned by image digest `sha256:abd8098f…` (= source commit `a4c2fa42`); runs as an amd64 chapkit service under emulation, so **Docker must be running**. Its development mean CRPS is **22.098**, the per-cell mean of four repeats scored from inside the tree in batch 7 (batch 4's reconnaissance figure was 21.9). It is **unseeded**: the four repeats span 21.820 to 22.385, so a margin under **~0.57 CRPS** against it means nothing. |
| Project seed, derived | Every component seed is `int(blake2b("<project seed>:<component>", digest_size=8), 16) % 2**32`, computed by `analysis/scripts/lib/project_seed.py`, which reads the project seed from the table above rather than carrying a copy. Fixed in batch 8, the first batch with anything to seed. |
| What counts as success | Beating both baselines and EWARS. Nothing here can reach statistical significance and no attempt is made to suggest it does: the comparison is reported with its per-region and per-split spread and a plain statement of what that spread can distinguish. "We cannot separate these two" is a conclusion. **The backtest's resolution is a property of the pair being compared, not of the dataset** — batch 7 measured about 4 CRPS using the baselines; batch 8's candidate cleared two standard errors; batch 9's candidate is **1.03 standard errors** from the reference, which is the "cannot separate" case arriving in practice. Nothing below **0.57 CRPS** can be attributed to a model at all, which is the reference's own re-run spread. |
| Shape of the reported result | A **spread, not a point**, on both datasets. The phase-D perturbation set is frozen before the holdout is opened and re-run on it, so development and holdout are both reported as distributions over the analyses that all looked reasonable. |
| Model service framework | `chapkit` may be used to build our own models against the Chap contract. Permitted, not mandated. |
| Development data | 1998-01 to 2009-12. The only file development ever sees. |
| Held-out data | 2010-01 to 2010-12. Sealed until the final validation. |
| Backtest scheme (`n-periods`, `n-splits`, `stride`) | **Development: 3, 8, 3** (`n-retrain` 1) — evaluates 2008-01 to 2009-12 from a training set ending 2007-12. **Phase E: 3, 4, 3** on the full file — evaluates exactly 2010. Fixed in batch 3; it does not move, because a horizon changed midway makes every earlier number incomparable. Verified against chap-core's own splitter in `analysis/01_data/02_characterise/results/split_schedule.csv`. |
| Git remote | None, and none is to be created. `/release` prepares the repository and stops. |

## What must not happen

These override everything else here.

1. **The final year is removed from the data before any work begins, and opened once.**
   2010 is cut off into a separate holdout file; development, tuning, selection and the whole
   backtest happen on 1998-01 to 2009-12 and nothing is pointed at anything else until the
   final validation. The holdout's case values are not read, plotted, characterised or
   reasoned about during development. If the holdout is opened a second time, that it happened
   and why is recorded. It is opened once but *evaluated* many times — across the frozen
   perturbation manifest — and that is only honest because the manifest was fixed beforehand:
   **nothing is added, dropped, re-tuned or re-run after a holdout number has been seen.**
2. **No number reaches a claim except through a file.** `chap eval` writes NetCDF, `chap
   export-metrics` writes CSV; every reported figure is read from one of those by a script,
   never from terminal output. (`AGENTS.md` §1.)
3. **Every judgment call is an alternatives node or a logged decision, never silent** — and
   carries its agency: `human-set`, `agent-on-human-assessment`, `agent-autonomous`; for
   information gathering, `agent-retrieved` or `human-pointed`.
4. **Failures are kept.** Models that did not work, installs that did not build, approaches
   abandoned: they stay in the record with what went wrong.
5. **Chap runs locally, from a pinned version** — not against a hosted service. If a local
   install proves genuinely impossible, stop and report rather than switching.

## Left to the human, not to the agent

Creating a git remote and naming it; anything that spends real money; abandoning the local
Chap install for a hosted service; any change to the success criterion or to the five points
above. The success criterion was settled on 2026-08-23 and is now fixed — including what to
do if EWARS cannot be run on this dataset, which the plan's §2 answers.

## Where things are

- The analysis is a tree of questions under `analysis/`. Start at
  `AI-generated/hierarchical-report/index.html`, or `/node tree`. Its full design — every node,
  every fork, the file contract between them, and the `COMBO` mechanism that lets one code path
  serve both the main analysis and the stability run — is in
  `AI-generated/batch-reports/26-08-26_b05_bootstrapPlan.md`. **Batch 7 built it**, and
  `bash analysis/run.sh` reproduces the whole reported analysis in about twenty minutes.
  `analysis/README.md` is the map. Every node below `01_data` reads and writes under
  `results/$COMBO/`, which defaults to `main`. **Batch 8 added `03_models/03_candidate`**,
  our own model families: `a_hierNB` and the four forks that configure it. Its
  configuration reaches the model as a file assembled from those forks and passed to
  `chap eval --model-configuration-yaml`, which is also where the component seed enters.
  **Batch 9 built every remaining child of those forks and added two more forks** —
  `05_autoregressive` and `06_yearVariance` — ran all nine alternatives on development, and
  promoted three of them onto the main path. The candidate now beats both required baselines
  and is 1.03 standard errors from the reference. A second environment variable,
  `COMBO_BASE`, lets a combination inherit what it did not move; `analysis/run.sh` sets
  none, so the reported analysis inherits nothing. ***(branch)*** **Batch 21 iterated batch
  9's promotion rule to a fixpoint here**: three rounds moved `02_covariates` to `b_rich`,
  `04_fitTime` to `b_refitAtPredict` and `05_autoregressive` to `b_lag3`, and the fourth
  round found nothing outside the floor. The rule, the per-round records and the trajectory
  are in `AI-generated/candidate-forks/greedy/`, driven by
  `AI-internal/useful-scripts/greedy_iterate.py`.
- Batch reports, one per executed batch, are in `AI-generated/batch-reports/`. Checks on the
  method — clean-room, determinism — are in `AI-generated/validation/` and
  `AI-generated/determinism-checks/`. What every alternative to candidate 1's configuration
  scores, and the rule batch 9 promoted three forks by, are in
  `AI-generated/candidate-forks/`; the numbers there are copied from files inside the tree,
  and it is a phase-C selection aid rather than the phase-D stability result.
- The vertical slice that preceded the tree is in `AI-generated/vertical-slice/`. Its numbers
  are **not** reported results; the tree reproduces them exactly, and the persistence model
  itself now lives at `analysis/03_models/01_baselines/01_persistence/a_empiricalChange/`.
- What the reference model and the rest of Chap's model library can do on *this* dataset — the
  reference's score, cost and repeatability, and an inventory of the 39 `chap-models`
  repositories — is in `AI-generated/method-reconnaissance/`, rebuilt by
  `AI-internal/reconnaissance/`. Those numbers establish the criterion; they are not yet
  results of this project.
- What the Chap platform is and does — the CLI surface, the model contract, and one worked
  `chap eval` on an unrelated example dataset — is captured in
  `AI-generated/chap-reconnaissance/`, rebuilt by `AI-internal/reconnaissance/`. None of
  those numbers is a result of this project.
- Source material — the manuscript, the 2013 rules, the proposal and its supplement, and the
  Chap orientation note — is in `Archive/case-source-material/`.
- The data is in `Archive/lao-dataset/`, at commit `af362d52` of `dhis2/climate-health-data`,
  with a checksum manifest that `analysis/01_data/01_partition` re-verifies on every run. That
  node is the only one licensed to read the full file; everything else reads the development
  file it writes. `AI-internal/data-acquisition/` holds the fetch script.
- The plan **as it was delivered**, before any of it had been run, is in
  `Archive/plan-as-delivered/`. The live plan is edited as the project runs; how far the two
  have drifted, and who drove each change, is a reported result rather than bookkeeping. The
  plan's §4b logs each decision settled during execution, with its agency.
- Everything the analysis supports is in `Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md`.
- Nothing enters the manuscript that is not in that file.

## How to work here

- **Bring source material in**: place it in `Archive/`, marked `(IS_SHADOW)` on line 2,
  with a `provenance.md` beside it. Never edit it in place.
- **Add a question to the analysis**: `/node new <parent> <name> "<claim>"`.
- **After any analysis run**: `/track-result`, `/commit-run after`, `/validate invariants`.
- **When something is worth saying**: `/claims add`.
- **Before release**: `/validate cleanroom`, `/validate outsider`, `/hierarchical-report`,
  `/repro-report`, `/release`.

## What has to stay true

1. `analysis/run.sh` reproduces the reported analysis from a clean environment.
2. Every reported result traces to a file that was executed.
3. Every sentence in the manuscript traces to a claim, to a result, to a command.
4. The alternatives not taken are still in the tree, runnable.
5. `/validate invariants` passes, because it was satisfied rather than weakened.
6. This file describes the project as it actually is.
