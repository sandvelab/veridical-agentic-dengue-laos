**What it establishes.** Under the assembled flags — `n_retrain 1`, eight splits at stride
3 — one fit serves every split, and by the last split there are **21 months** of observed
history the fit never saw. That figure is read from the flag file rather than assumed,
because "fit once" only means what it says while `n_retrain` is 1, and `02_setup/04_retrain`
is a fork that can move it. A combination that moved it would leave this specification
recording `one_fit_serves_every_split: false` rather than quietly claiming otherwise.

**What is given up.** Chap hands `predict` an expanding historic window at every split, and
this child ignores it. The reference model refits inside predict, which is one reason its
score and ours are not comparable in the way two fits of one model would be — and is why
this is a fork rather than a convention.

alternatives-considered: `b_refitAtPredict`, retained as an unbuilt sibling until batch 9. It
costs a fit per split — about eight times this model's fitting time, which is two seconds —
and it makes the model a different model at each split, which is a property the stability
work should measure rather than a cost to avoid.

agency: agent-autonomous. Batch 4 raised refitting-at-predict as an open question (§9.2) and
batch 5 made it a fork; taking the cheaper child as the main path at the defaults is this
batch's.

## Batch 9 addendum — the fork sweep, 2026-08-27

```
commit:              15b8516   (round 2, and the promoted main path)
                     49825b5   (round 1, which round 2 replaced in the tree; its table
                                is kept at AI-generated/candidate-forks/round1_batch8Defaults/)

```

This fork did not move in batch 9: its best sibling stayed inside the 0.57 CRPS floor, so
this child is still the main path. `results/main/model_option_spec.json` was regenerated
anyway, because every combination re-runs the whole candidate and because the
specification gained an `input_from_combo` field -- which records, for a combination that
inherits the common ground it did not move, where that ground came from. On `main` it
reads `main`, because `analysis/run.sh` sets no base and can inherit nothing.

The siblings built and run in batch 9 are named in their own records. Their scores from
the promoted main path: `b_refitAtPredict` +0.873, the best combination in the second sweep and outside the floor
(`AI-generated/candidate-forks/round2_promoted/fork_interaction.csv`).

## Batch 21 addendum — demoted on the branch `greedy`, round 1, 2026-08-27

```
result:              results/fitTime_trainOnly/model_option_spec.json
                     (its results/main/ was removed when the fork moved)

invocation:          "$PYTHON" scripts/choose_fit_time.py, from this node's run.sh with
                     COMBO=fitTime_trainOnly and COMBO_BASE=main, driven by

**On this branch, fitting once in train is what the model gives up to reach its score.**
Round 3 measured it at 22.560 against the fixpoint's 21.275: reverting to it costs **1.285**
CRPS, the largest reversion cost of any of the six forks. It also buys back everything the
refit costs — 36 seconds a backtest instead of 91, and a fitted object that exists.

**On `main` this is the main path.**

branch.
