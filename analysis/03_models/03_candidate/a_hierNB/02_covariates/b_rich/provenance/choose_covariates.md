**What it establishes.** Nine standardised climate columns instead of two, at the cost
of the first three months of every province's record: 1 961 usable rows against 2 012
for a model with no climate term at all.

**What the run of it established.** It scores **22.877** mean CRPS against the main
path's 23.698, which is the second-best combination in the second sweep and clears the
0.57 CRPS floor. Its fitted coefficients say why the covariate question is not settled:
mean temperature at lag 1 (**+0.653**) and lag 3 (**+0.594**) carry far more than
rainfall at any lag (**−0.084**, **−0.132**, **−0.013**), and the seasonal harmonics
shrink toward zero as the climate columns take over the annual cycle — `sin1` falls
from −1.235 on the main path to **−0.027** here. The two are substituting for each
other rather than adding, which is the same finding the climate-free child gives from
the other side.

**It was not promoted**, and that is a decision rather than an oversight: batch 9
applies its promotion rule once, from the sweep taken around the batch-8
configuration, where this child was worth 0.461 and inside the floor.

alternatives-considered: A per-covariate lag rather than one lag list applied to all three columns, which
    would let temperature enter at lag 1 and rainfall at lag 3; not built, because it is a
    sibling of this fork rather than an option, and because this child's coefficients are
    the evidence that would motivate it. Lag 0, rejected: a covariate contemporaneous with
    the forecast month is not available at forecast time.

## Batch 21 addendum — promoted on the branch `greedy`, round 1, 2026-08-27

**On this branch it was promoted**, in round 1, because the greedy rule is batch 9's rule
without the "applied once" clause: measured from batch 9's promoted path this child was
worth **+0.821** CRPS, outside the 0.57 floor, and the rule takes every fork whose best
child clears it.

**What it is worth at the fixpoint.** Round 3 measured the fork again from the branch's
final path: putting the two lagged covariates back (`a_lagged`) scores 22.027 against
21.275, so the rich set is now worth **+0.752** — a third measurement of this fork, after
+0.461 around batch 8's configuration and +0.821 around batch 9's. The fork's answer on the
main line stands: what each child is worth depends on where it is measured from, and this
child's three measurements span 0.36 CRPS.

**Nothing here is on `main`.** The main line's covariates fork takes `c_climateFree`, and
this record's section above — "it was not promoted" — is the record of the reported
analysis.

branch.
