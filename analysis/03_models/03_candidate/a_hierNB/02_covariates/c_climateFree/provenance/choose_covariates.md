**What it establishes.** With no lagged column required, no row is dropped for a lag
falling before a province's record begins, so this child fits on **2 012** usable rows
against the lagged child's 1 978 — the 34 rows a two-month lag was discarding at the
start of each province's record.

**What the run of it established.** Around the batch-8 configuration, dropping the
climate covariates entirely *improved* the candidate, from 26.100 to **25.452** mean
CRPS, and that is why it was promoted. Measured again from the promoted main path the
sign reverses: putting the two lagged covariates back is worth **+0.112**
(`round2_promoted/fork_interaction.csv`), so from where the model now stands the
climate-free choice is marginally the worse one. Both numbers are inside or close to
the 0.57 CRPS floor, and the honest reading is that **this fork cannot be settled on
this dataset** — which is itself the finding, and it bears on a reference model whose
premise is that climate drives an early warning.

alternatives-considered: `b_rich`, which takes the opposite position and scores better than either around
    the promoted configuration; retained and re-run rather than adopted, because the
    promotion rule was applied once and this fork's answer moves with the others. Leaving
    the fork at `a_lagged`, which is what batch 8 did and what the reference family's own
    published Lao configuration does.

**On this branch it is the alternative, not the main path.** It scores 22.027 against the
branch's 21.275 at the fixpoint — that is `a_lagged`; this child was measured in round 2 at
22.545 against 21.857, so returning to it costs 0.688 CRPS from where the branch stood
then. **On `main` it is the main path**, and the record of the reported analysis is the
section above.

agency: agent-autonomous, under a human-set instruction to explore the iterated path on a
branch.
