**What it establishes.** The route model configuration takes into an `MLproject` model,
which batches 2, 4 and 7 all left open because no model had needed it. It is chap-core's own
and it is a file at every step: `chap eval --model-configuration-yaml` parses the file into
a `ModelConfiguration` (`user_option_values` and `additional_continuous_covariates`, extra
fields forbidden), writes it back out as `model_configuration_for_run.yaml` in the run
directory, and substitutes that filename for the `{model_config}` placeholder declared in the
model's entry points. The model reads its own configuration from disk. Nothing about a run's
configuration lives only in a command line.

**Why the assembler exists rather than a configuration file checked in beside the model.** A
checked-in file would be a fifth place where the four forks' decisions are recorded, and the
one the model actually read. Assembling it means the forks are the only source: change which
child of a fork runs and the configuration changes with it, without an edit anywhere. It is
the same mechanism `02_setup/scripts/assemble_setup.py` uses for the dataset, and for the same
reason.

**The clash check.** Two forks setting the same option would mean two nodes owning one
property of the model, which is a design error in the tree rather than a value to resolve at
merge time. The script raises instead of merging.

alternatives-considered: passing the options as command-line flags to `chap eval` (there is
no such interface, and inventing one would take the model off the platform's own route);
writing the seed into the model's source (it would then be a constant of the model rather
than a derivation of the project seed, and Rule 6's "one seed derived downward" would be
satisfied only by inspection). Also considered: deriving the component seed from the node
name alone rather than from the project seed. Rejected — that is a second independent seed
wearing the project seed's name.

agency: agent-autonomous. The mechanism is chap-core's (`agent-retrieved`, read from
chap_core/runners/helper_functions.py and confirmed against
chap-models/ewars_plus_template's own MLproject); the assembler's shape follows batch 5's
file contract, which is the human-approved design.

**Two changes to the assembler, both so that it stops having to be told things.** The fork
list is now discovered from the node's own children rather than named, because batch 9
added a fifth and a sixth fork and a script carrying the count would have had to be edited
to notice them -- a script that can be wrong about what the model is while still running.
And each fork's chosen child is resolved through `COMBO_BASE`: a combination that moves one
fork has no child with results under it at the other five, and inherits their choices from
the base. Which combination answered each fork is written into `candidate_spec.json` as
`choice_combos`, so a configuration assembled partly from another combination's choices
says so on its face.

**The main path's configuration changed** with the promotion: `observation: hurdle`,
`covariates: []`, `year_variance: province_scaled`, with `population: offset`,
`fit_time: train` and `autoregressive: none` unchanged. The component seed is unchanged at
**849487747**, derived as before from project seed 20260822 by
`analysis/scripts/lib/project_seed.py` -- promoting a fork changes what the model is, not
which component it is.

alternatives-considered: deriving a fresh component seed for the promoted configuration, so
that two configurations of one model never share a draw sequence; rejected, because the
seed is a property of the node and re-deriving it on every promotion would mean a
configuration change and a seed change arriving together, with no way to attribute a score
difference to either.

agency: agent-autonomous.

## Batch 21 addendum — the greedy branch's configuration, 2026-08-27

```
result:              results/main/model_configuration.yaml
                     results/main/candidate_spec.json
                     and the nine combination directories the three rounds' sweeps wrote
script:              scripts/assemble_candidate_config.py   unchanged
invocation:          "$PYTHON" scripts/assemble_candidate_config.py, from a_hierNB/run.sh
                     with COMBO=main and no COMBO_BASE
commit:              cb61c1d
instructions-commit: cf97b81
produced:            2026-08-27
```

**What the assembled configuration became.** `configuration_sha256`
**8e021eaf2d1e3751…**, from `28c7c617d5c26fa0…` on the main line: `observation: hurdle`,
`covariates` all three at `covariate_lags [1, 2, 3]`, `population: offset`,
`fit_time: predict`, `autoregressive: lag3`, `year_variance: province_scaled`. Seed
unchanged at 849487747, derived as before, and `choice_combos` records all six choices as
taken under `main` — the branch's main path inherits nothing, exactly as the reported
analysis does not.

Three intermediate configurations existed and were each scored: batch 9's, round 1's, and
round 2's, which is the fixpoint. The two that were superseded are recorded in
`AI-generated/candidate-forks/greedy/round_NN.json` by the combination each round measured
rather than by their own directories, which the promotion removed.

agency: agent-autonomous, under a human-set instruction to explore the iterated path on a
branch.
