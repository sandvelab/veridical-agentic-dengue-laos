**What it establishes.** One file per combination stating what that analysis concluded: the
skill score `1 − CRPS_ours / CRPS_reference`, with raw CRPS, both coverage figures, the
paired difference and the resolvable-difference floor beside it. **Nothing anywhere else in
the repository states the conclusion**, which is what stops a sentence in a report drifting
from the file it came from. Phase D's stability driver calls this same script once per
combination, so the development spread will be a set of these files and not a second
implementation of the analysis.

**What it says at this batch, and what it does not.** The project has two baselines and no
candidate: `03_models/03_candidate` is built in phase C. So `candidate_exists` is **false**,
the headline model is the best-scoring model of ours, and its role is recorded in the file
as a placeholder. That is deliberate — promoting a baseline to a candidate quietly would make
the file readable and wrong, and the alternative of leaving the conclusion uncomputed until
phase C would mean the root's contract was first exercised at the moment it had to carry a
real result. The vertical slice's argument, one level up.

**Which model is "ours" is resolved from the tree, not chosen here.** Once
`03_models/03_candidate` exists, the script reads its `main-path` field and takes that
child's model. So promoting an alternative with `/node promote` changes the reported
conclusion, and the commit that promotes it is the record of when the reported model
changed — which is exactly the kind of decision that otherwise disappears.

alternatives-considered: the reported model could have been named in a configuration file at
`03_models`, which would be simpler to read. Rejected: it would be a second place where the
main path is declared, and two declarations of the same thing disagree eventually. Reporting
a raw CRPS as the conclusion rather than a skill score was settled against in §4b, on the
reasoning that development and holdout are different years and their raw scores are not
comparable. Falling back to the *persistence* baseline specifically, rather than to the best
of ours, was considered — it is more stable across batches — and rejected because it would
mean the conclusion file ignored a better model of ours that had actually been run.

agency: agent-autonomous, within a human-set frame. The skill score as the reported
conclusion is the human's choice from an agent proposal (§4b, 2026-08-23,
agent-on-human-assessment); computing it at the root, and how "our model" is resolved before
a candidate exists, are the agent's.

## Batch 9 addendum — the fork sweep, 2026-08-27

```
commit:              15b8516   (round 2, and the promoted main path)
                     49825b5   (round 1, which round 2 replaced in the tree; its table
                                is kept at AI-generated/candidate-forks/round1_batch8Defaults/)
instructions-commit: cf97b81
produced:            2026-08-27
```

Re-run on `main` after the promotion. The project's reported skill score against the
reference moved from **−0.181** to **−0.072**, and `beats_all_baselines` became **true**
for the first time: the candidate's 23.698 is below climatology's 24.337 and persistence's
24.879. `beats_reference` remains false.

The file is unchanged in shape and the script is unchanged. What changed is the main path
through `03_models/03_candidate`, which is where `conclude.py` resolves our reported model
from -- so the conclusion moved because the tree moved, which is the property batch 7 built
the script to have.

alternatives-considered: none new.

agency: agent-autonomous.

## Batch 21 addendum — the greedy branch, 2026-08-27

**Branch `greedy` only; not a reported result of the project.** Re-run unchanged over the
model the greedy iteration promoted, three rounds of batch 9's rule applied to a fixpoint.

```
result:              results/main/conclusion.json
script:              unchanged
invocation:          unchanged, with COMBO=main and no COMBO_BASE, driven by
                     AI-internal/useful-scripts/greedy_iterate.py once per round
commit:              cb61c1d
instructions-commit: cf97b81
produced:            2026-08-27
```

Skill score **+0.037** against the reference, from -0.072 on the main line; `beats_reference` true, `beats_all_baselines` true. The same script computed it, from the same stored scores, by the same route -- which is the point of having one place where the conclusion is computed. What changed is three rounds of selection on the 371 development cells the score is then read off.

agency: agent-autonomous, under a human-set instruction to explore the iterated path on a
branch.
