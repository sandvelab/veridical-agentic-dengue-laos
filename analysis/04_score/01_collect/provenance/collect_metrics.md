seeds:               none. Every value is read out of a stored evaluation file; the
                     script computes no statistic of its own beyond a mean over the
                     reference's repeats. Project seed 20260822 unused.

**What it establishes.** One file at the platform's finest resolution — one row per model,
province, target month and lead time, carrying CRPS, absolute error, both interval
indicators and the observed value — from which every reported figure in the project is an
aggregation. Nothing downstream re-derives a score, so no two reported numbers can disagree
about what a model scored.

**This node implements no metric.** Every value comes from chap-core's own registered metric
class, asked for by id (`crps`, `mae`, `coverage_10_90`, `coverage_25_75`) at its detailed
resolution. The only things the script chooses are the level of aggregation — the finest one
available — and the split label, recovered by the arithmetic batch 2 established,
`split = time_period − (horizon_distance − 1)`. A metric of our own would be the one we
could most easily bend without it being visible, which is why §4b rules it out for this
project.

**Models are discovered, not listed.** A model reaches this file by having run, and by no
other route. That is what makes the node indifferent to which child of a fork produced a
model — exactly one child has results under any one combination — and it is what will let
phase C add a candidate without editing the scoring node.

**The unseeded reference is carried twice over.** Each of its four repeats becomes its own
row (`reference_r1` … `reference_r4`), and a further row (`reference`) holds the per-cell
mean over them. Every repeat scored the identical cells, so the mean is an average over
draws of the same quantity rather than over different evaluations. Downstream, the mean is
the denominator of the skill score, which stops a 2 % wobble in an external model's sampler
being read as an effect of one of our own choices; the individual repeats are what say how
large that wobble was here.

alternatives-considered: the reference's repeats could have been reduced to a mean here and
the repeats discarded, which would have halved this file. Rejected — the repeat-to-repeat
spread is the noise floor of the entire comparison and it has to be recomputable from stored
scores rather than quoted from batch 4. Aggregating to province level in this node was also
rejected: the paired comparison needs per-cell rows, and an aggregation that cannot be
undone is a decision taken at the wrong time. Accumulating rows into an existing file, which
is what the vertical slice's version did, was replaced by rebuilding from the discovered
specs, because an accumulating file can hold a row from a model that no longer exists.

agency: agent-autonomous. That the metric is always chap-core's is §4b's decision from batch
2; the discovery mechanism and the treatment of the reference's repeats are this batch's,
implementing batch 5's design.
information: agent-retrieved — chap-core's metric API surface was established in batch 2.

## Batch 9 addendum — the fork sweep, 2026-08-27

```

**Models may now be inherited, and every row says whether it was.** When `COMBO_BASE` is
set, a model node with no results under this combination is taken from the base
combination, and `models.csv` carries a `scored_under_combo` column. That is what makes a
candidate-internal fork cheap: it changed nothing the reference or the baselines face, and
the reference is unseeded, so re-running it would replace its four repeats with a different
draw and move the denominator of every comparison for reasons unrelated to the fork. On
`main` nothing is inherited, because `analysis/run.sh` sets no base.

In every one of the nine sweep combinations, `hier_nb` was scored under the combination and
the reference, persistence and climatology under `main`.

alternatives-considered: re-running the reference in each combination, which is what the
phase-D manifest does for a fork that moves the data or the evaluation; not done here,
because a candidate-internal fork moves neither, and batch 4 measured the reference's
re-run spread at sd 0.196 CRPS -- comparable to several of the fork effects being measured.
Merging a combination's own models with the base's for the same node; refused in
`combos.resolve_glob`, because a merged answer would describe an analysis that never ran.

agency: agent-autonomous.

## Batch 21 addendum — the greedy branch, 2026-08-27

**Branch `greedy` only; not a reported result of the project.** Re-run unchanged over the
model the greedy iteration promoted, three rounds of batch 9's rule applied to a fixpoint.

```
result:              results/main/metrics_cell.csv · results/main/models.csv
                     and the nine sweep combinations' equivalents, of which three are new
                     on this branch:
                     autoregressive_none/metrics_cell.csv · autoregressive_none/models.csv
                     covariates_climateFree/metrics_cell.csv
                     covariates_climateFree/models.csv
                     fitTime_trainOnly/metrics_cell.csv · fitTime_trainOnly/models.csv
script:              unchanged
invocation:          unchanged, with COMBO=main and no COMBO_BASE, driven by
                     AI-internal/useful-scripts/greedy_iterate.py once per round

produced:            2026-08-27
```

The per-cell scores everything on this branch is computed from. The reference's four repeats and both baselines are **inherited from what they scored on the main line** rather than re-run, and `models.csv` carries the combination each row was scored under; only `hier_nb` moved.

agency: agent-autonomous, under a human-set instruction to explore the iterated path on a
branch.
