**What it shows.** Every model's mean CRPS per province on a log scale, provinces ordered by
the dengue burden that produced it, with 10–90 interval coverage beside it. This is the
figure batch 6 said batch 7 would draw once two models were in the tree, and it exists
because the headline number is an unweighted mean over provinces whose burdens differ by
four orders of magnitude: an aggregate coverage close to nominal can be an average of a
province covered every time and a province covered almost never, and batch 6 measured
exactly that on one model.

The reference's four repeats are not drawn individually; the row drawn for it is the
per-cell mean over them, which is what the conclusion divides by. The repeats are in the
pre-aggregation file.

**Plotted values** are in `fig_crps_by_location.csv`. **Pre-aggregation values** are in
`fig_crps_by_location_preaggregation.csv` — the per-cell scores the province means average.

**One thing the axis label had to be corrected about.** The count beside each province is the
cases in the **evaluated** cells, 2008-01 to 2009-12, not over the whole record — it is what
the score is averaged against, and the two orderings are not the same province ordering. The
first version said only "cases", which would have invited a reader to compare it with batch
3's per-province totals over twelve years.

alternatives-considered: a linear CRPS axis was rejected because Vientiane Capital's mean
is two orders of magnitude above Phongsaly's and everything but the capital would sit on the
axis. Ordering provinces alphabetically rather than by burden was rejected: the ordering is
what makes the relationship between burden and score legible, and it is the relationship the
figure exists to show.

## Batch 9 addendum — the fork sweep, 2026-08-27

```
commit:              15b8516   (round 2, and the promoted main path)
                     49825b5   (round 1, which round 2 replaced in the tree; its table
                                is kept at AI-generated/candidate-forks/round1_batch8Defaults/)
instructions-commit: cf97b81
produced:            2026-08-27
```

Regenerated on `main` after the promotion, from the promoted candidate's scores. The sweep
combinations do not reach this node: batch 9 stops at `02_aggregate`, because a conclusion
per sibling is the phase-D deliverable and producing nine of them here would report the
stability answer before the manifest that makes it honest has been frozen.

**What moved.** The candidate's paired difference against the reference fell from **4.002**
CRPS to **1.599**, and its split-clustered standard error is **1.551**, so the difference
is **1.03 standard errors** -- against 3.62 for the batch-8 configuration. The comparison
that batch 8 could resolve, this one cannot: on the development backtest our candidate and
the field's own model are not distinguishable. It wins 41 % of cells and 2 of 8 splits.

alternatives-considered: none new; the node's own choices are batch 7's.

## Batch 21 addendum — regenerated on the branch `greedy`, 2026-08-27

**Branch `greedy` only.** The figure and both of its value files were regenerated over the
model three rounds of batch 9's promotion rule promoted — mean CRPS 21.275 against the main
line's 23.698 — by the same script, unchanged, with COMBO=main.
