**What it establishes.** Two things. The leaderboard, assembled from the stored scores and
the stored run costs, which is the file phase C adds candidates to and the one the plan
requires never to be typed. And the answer to the question batch 4 left open and batch 5
made this batch's reason for existing: **whether a paired per-cell comparison on 371 cells
can separate two models at all.**

**Why paired, and why four ways.** Batch 4 measured the split-to-split standard error of the
reference's own CRPS at 5.65, a quarter of its mean, and observed that no plausible model
difference clears that. But that variation is mostly the difficulty of the period, common to
both models, and it cancels cell by cell. What is left is what this node measures, and it
measures it four ways because the easy answer is the wrong one:

- the per-cell standard error, which assumes 371 independent observations. They are not
  independent — three lead times of the same forecast and neighbouring months of the same
  province move together — so this figure flatters the comparison and is reported as the
  optimistic bound rather than as the answer;
- the same standard error clustered by province and by split, which allows arbitrary
  correlation inside a cluster. With sixteen provinces and eight splits this is a small
  number of clusters, so it is indicative rather than exact;
- the comparison at the split level, over eight paired numbers, which needs no independence
  assumption inside a split at all;
- **the noise floor**: the identical paired statistic computed between two repeats of the
  reference against itself. Because the reference is unseeded, two of its repeats differ by
  its sampler and by nothing else, so the largest paired difference among its own repeats is
  a difference this evaluation demonstrably cannot attribute to a model. It is the
  comparison's resolution, computed in the same units as the comparison, on the same cells.

**No significance test is reported and none is implied.** The plan settled before any number
existed that statistical significance is not attainable here and is not to be suggested
(§4b, human-set). What is reported is the spread and a plain statement of what it can
distinguish; "we cannot separate these two" is one of the answers.

alternatives-considered: a paired bootstrap over provinces would give a confidence interval
without the closed-form clustering assumption and was not run — it would introduce
randomness into a node that currently has none, and with sixteen clusters it would be
resampling the same small set. It is the obvious extension if the clustered figures turn out
to be load-bearing, and it is recorded here as not run rather than not considered. A
Diebold-Mariano test was rejected: it is a significance test, and the plan forbids implying
significance. Comparing against each reference repeat separately *instead of* against their
mean was rejected in favour of doing both — the mean is the denominator the conclusion uses
and the per-repeat comparisons are what calibrate it.

agency: agent-autonomous. That the comparison must be paired rather than unpaired is batch
4's finding (agent-autonomous, recorded there); computing it, and computing the noise floor
from the reference's own repeats rather than assuming a resolution, is this batch's.

## Batch 9 addendum — the fork sweep, 2026-08-27

```
commit:              15b8516   (round 2, and the promoted main path)
                     49825b5   (round 1, which round 2 replaced in the tree; its table
                                is kept at AI-generated/candidate-forks/round1_batch8Defaults/)
instructions-commit: cf97b81
produced:            2026-08-27
```

Regenerated on `main` after the promotion, from the promoted candidate's scores. The sweep
combinations do not reach this node: batch 9 stops at `02_aggregate`, because a conclusion
per sibling is the phase-D deliverable and producing nine of them here would report the
stability answer before the manifest that makes it honest has been frozen.

**What moved.** The candidate's paired difference against the reference fell from **4.002**
CRPS to **1.599**, and its split-clustered standard error is **1.551**, so the difference
is **1.03 standard errors** -- against 3.62 for the batch-8 configuration. The comparison
that batch 8 could resolve, this one cannot: on the development backtest our candidate and
the field's own model are not distinguishable. It wins 41 % of cells and 2 of 8 splits.

alternatives-considered: none new; the node's own choices are batch 7's.

agency: agent-autonomous.

## Batch 21 addendum — the greedy branch, 2026-08-27

**Branch `greedy` only; not a reported result of the project.** Re-run unchanged over the
model the greedy iteration promoted, three rounds of batch 9's rule applied to a fixpoint.

```

The branch's model is **first on the leaderboard**, ahead of all four of the reference's repeats individually. And the paired comparison says the two cannot be separated: -0.823 CRPS with a split-clustered standard error of 1.602, 0.51 standard errors, 50.4 % of cells and 3 of 8 splits. Both statements come from this file and neither is reportable without the other.

agency: agent-autonomous, under a human-set instruction to explore the iterated path on a
branch.
