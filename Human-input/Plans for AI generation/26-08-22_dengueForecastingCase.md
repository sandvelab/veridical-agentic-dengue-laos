# Develop a spatio-temporal dengue forecasting model for Laos, veridically

The plan this repository exists to execute. It is written to be run by an agent that has
none of the conversation behind it in context: everything needed to start is either here or
in `Archive/case-source-material/`.

**Source material** — read before batch 1, and re-read the relevant part when a batch touches it:

- [[chapOrientation]] — the platform, the dataset, the evaluation command, and what was *not* verified
- [[reproAgenticAiManuscript]] — the manuscript this analysis is the worked case for; its
  *proposed comprehensive agentic AI setup* section specifies the claim tree, and its Appendix
  specifies what the case must demonstrate
- [[tenSimpleRules2013]] — the original rules the manuscript updates
- [[trustAgenticProposal]] — why an autonomously developed forecasting method on a real case
  is the interesting test, and what counts as an honest assessment of one
- [[trustAgenticSupplementary]] — §S2 model families worth trying, §S3 the provenance-and-agency
  schema, §S4 the veridical-robustness protocol

---

## 1. The aim

**Develop, as autonomously as the setup allows, a spatio-temporal model that forecasts
monthly dengue case counts across the provinces of Laos, and make it perform decently under
Chap's own standard evaluation.**

The dataset is `chap_LAO_admin1_monthly.csv` from
`https://github.com/dhis2/climate-health-data/tree/main/lao`: monthly dengue counts per
admin-1 province, 1998–2010, with rainfall, mean temperature, mean relative humidity and a
population figure. The evaluation is Chap's standard cross-validated backtest, run through
`chap eval`. The headline number is **mean CRPS across regions and across test splits**.

Two things are being produced at once, and neither is subordinate to the other:

1. **A forecasting model, with a defensible score.** A real result, developed the way the
   method would actually be developed.
2. **The complete veridical record of how it came about** — every execution, every
   environment, every judgment call and the alternatives to it, and how far the conclusion
   survives them. This record is what the manuscript reports on.

The second is the reason the first is being done. A model that scores well but whose
development is not reconstructable is a failed run of this project.

## 2. What "decently" means

CRPS has no absolute scale, so the criterion is comparative. The reference is a specific,
already-integrated Chap model: **`https://github.com/chap-models/chapkit_ewars_model`** — the
WHO EWARS-csd early-warning model for dengue. The aim is a model whose mean CRPS is:

- **below both required baselines** — persistence (next month = last observed month) and
  seasonal climatology (next month = mean of that calendar month in the training window);
- **and below `chapkit_ewars_model`**, both on the cross-validated backtest over the
  development dataset **and** on the held-out final year (§3).

**The aim is to conclude, and the conclusion will be an uncertain call.** One year of
holdout is roughly 216 province-months and twelve years of development data give a handful
of meaningful splits; nothing here will reach statistical significance, and no attempt should
be made to dress it up as though it had. What is reported is the comparison, its per-region
and per-split spread, and a plain statement of how much that spread can distinguish. An
honest "we cannot separate these two" is a conclusion.

**The comparison is a spread, not a point, on both datasets.** The stability work of phase D
produces a distribution of development results over the reasonable alternatives to each
judgment call, and **that same enumerated set is carried forward to the held-out year**, so
the final validation also yields a spread rather than a single number. The question is then
not "did our best configuration beat EWARS on one number" but "across the analyses that all
looked reasonable, how often and by how much did it, and on development and holdout alike".
That is the veridical form of the question and it is the one worth answering.

Report the mean CRPS with the per-region and per-split values behind it, and report
calibration (interval coverage) alongside. **A model that wins on mean CRPS while being
badly calibrated has not won**, and saying so is more useful than hiding it.

If, after the model-development phase, no candidate beats the baselines or EWARS, that is
the result. Report it plainly, with what was tried and what it cost. A negative result here
is a perfectly good outcome for the manuscript and a dishonest positive one is not.

**If `chapkit_ewars_model` turns out not to be runnable on this dataset, stop and bring it
back to me.** Report what blocked it, in detail — that is itself a finding about the
platform's model library, and a useful one. Then we reconsider §2 together and may well
choose a different method as the reference. The intent behind naming EWARS is that the model
should be **competitive against something real that the field already uses**, not that it be
competitive against that model specifically; a practical obstacle is a reason to change the
reference, not a reason to lower the aim. Do not pick the replacement on your own initiative,
and do not quietly fall back to the two required baselines as though they were the criterion.

*Settled 2026-08-23, in dialogue, from the batch-1 report §3.2. The reference model, the
requirement to beat it on both datasets, the refusal to imply significance, and the fallback
route are **human-set**; see §4b for what within this section the agent proposed.*

## 3. Non-negotiables

These override anything else in this plan. They are here because they are the specific ways
this particular project could go quietly wrong.

**The final year is removed from the data before any work begins, and touched once.** The
dataset runs 1998-01 to 2010-12. **2010 is cut off and set aside**; everything — model
development, tuning, selection, comparison, the whole of Chap's standard cross-validated
backtest — happens on the **development dataset, 1998-01 to 2009-12**, and until the final
validation of phase E nothing is ever pointed at anything but that file. At the end, in a
single batch, the holdout is opened and the final candidate, the baselines and
`chapkit_ewars_model` are validated against the held-out year.

This is stronger than splitting the backtest, because the held-out year is not merely
excluded from a metric — it is not in the file. An agent cannot leak what it cannot open.

Three consequences, all of them binding:

- **The holdout file is sealed.** During development, do not read its case values, plot
  them, characterise them, or reason about them. Batch 3 may confirm it is complete and
  well-formed — row counts, provinces present, no missing months — and nothing further.
- **If the holdout has to be opened a second time, record that it happened and why.** A
  holdout consulted three times is a development set, and calling it otherwise makes the
  headline number a lie.
- **The perturbation set run on the holdout is frozen before the holdout is opened.** §2 asks
  for a spread on the held-out year as well as on development, which means the holdout is
  opened once but evaluated many times — and that is only honest if *what* gets evaluated was
  fixed in advance. So phase D commits a perturbation manifest, phase E runs exactly that
  manifest, and **nothing is added, dropped, re-tuned or re-run after a holdout number has
  been seen.** A spread computed from a set chosen after looking is not a spread, it is
  selection with extra steps.
- **One year is a thin holdout**, roughly 216 province-months. Report the validation number
  with its per-region and per-split values and an honest statement of how much it can
  distinguish. Do not read a small difference between two candidates as a ranking.

**No number reaches a claim except through a file.** `chap eval` writes NetCDF; `chap
export-metrics` writes CSV. Every reported figure is read from one of those by a script, not
from terminal output by you. This is `AGENTS.md` §1 and it is the single most likely way this
project ends up dishonest.

**Every judgment call is a node or a logged decision, never silent.** Covariate set, lag
structure, model family, how population is used, how the zero-heavy early years are handled,
transformation of the target, horizon — each is either an alternatives node in the tree with
its rejected siblings intact, or an explicitly logged decision with its basis. See
[[trustAgenticSupplementary]] §S3 for the schema and §S4 for the protocol.

**Agency is recorded on every decision**: `human-set`, `agent-on-human-assessment`, or
`agent-autonomous`; and for information gathering, `agent-retrieved` or `human-pointed`. The
default here is `agent-autonomous` — that is the point of the exercise — so the entries that
matter are the exceptions. Do not flatter your own contribution, and do not flatter mine.

**Failures are kept.** Models that did not work, installs that did not build, approaches
abandoned: they stay in the record with what went wrong. The negative space is a deliverable,
not clutter.

**Chap runs locally, from a pinned version.** Not against a hosted service. An analysis whose
result depends on a remote service's current state cannot be reproduced from a clean
environment, which would defeat the whole project. If a local install turns out to be
genuinely impossible, stop and report it rather than silently switching — that finding is
itself worth having.

## 4. Decisions already made

Settled here so that execution does not reopen them. Where a decision turns out to be wrong,
say so and propose the change; do not quietly take a different one.

| | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Project seed** | `20260822`. Every component seed derives from it. |
| **Target** | `disease_cases` (reported dengue), monthly, admin-1, Laos. |
| **Development data** | 1998-01 to 2009-12. The only file development ever sees. |
| **Held-out data** | 2010-01 to 2010-12, sealed until the final validation (§3). |
| **Metric** | Mean CRPS across regions × splits, from Chap's own evaluation. Secondary: interval coverage, MAE. |
| **Required baselines** | Persistence and seasonal climatology, implemented as Chap-compatible models so they traverse the identical evaluation path. A baseline evaluated a different way is not a comparison. |
| **Reference model** | `https://github.com/chap-models/chapkit_ewars_model`, at its own default configuration. The target to beat on development and on holdout (§2). Not a candidate of ours and not tuned by us. *(human-set, 2026-08-23)* |
| **Stability on the holdout** | The phase-D perturbation manifest is frozen and re-run on the held-out year, so the final validation reports a spread over reasonable analyses rather than one number (§2, §3). *(human-set, 2026-08-23)* |
| **Model service framework** | `chapkit` (`github.com/dhis2-chap/chapkit`) may be used to build our own models against the Chap contract. Permitted, not mandated; whichever route is taken is a logged decision with its basis. *(human-set, 2026-08-23)* |
| **Where Chap runs** | Locally, version pinned by commit and recorded in the environment. |
| **Tracking level** | Full (`AGENTS.md` §6). This project is *about* tracking; the usual argument for a lighter touch does not apply. |
| **Data** | Pinned by repository commit hash, copied into `Archive/` unmodified, marked `(IS_SHADOW)`, with `provenance.md`. Public and redistributable. |
| **Scope of the tree** | The whole analysis, from data acquisition to reported score, is in `analysis/`. Nothing important happens outside it. |
| **Sibling datasets** | `tha` and `vnm` are **not** part of the headline analysis. They are an optional external check in phase E, and only if the budget survives that far. |
| **Git remote** | Do **not** create one. The release batch prepares the repository and stops for me. |

## 4b. Decisions settled during execution

§4 is what was fixed before the project started. This section accumulates what gets settled
while it runs, and **it is not an appendix to the plan but part of the result**. The purpose
of this project is the human's; how to carry it out is resolved in dialogue, and a record
that showed only the outcome of that dialogue and not its shape would misrepresent how the
work was actually done.

So each entry carries its agency honestly, in the vocabulary of `AGENTS.md` §4 — **human-set**
where the human decided, **agent-on-human-assessment** where the agent proposed and the human
chose, **agent-autonomous** where the agent decided alone and the human did not object. Do not
flatter either contribution. Where an entry changed the plan's text, the commit that made the
change carries the reasoning, and `Archive/plan-as-delivered/` holds the plan as it stood
before any of this.

### 2026-08-23 — settling §2, after the batch-1 report

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| The reference is `chapkit_ewars_model`, at its own configuration, to be beaten on the development backtest **and** on the held-out year | Named directly by the human, replacing §2's unoperationalised "within reach of the best already-integrated Chap model". | human-set |
| Statistical significance is not attainable here and is not to be implied; the aim is to conclude, and to report the call as uncertain | The human's, and stated before any number exists — which is what makes it credible. A project that discovers its result is inconclusive and only then decides inconclusiveness is acceptable has decided nothing. | human-set |
| The stability spread is carried forward from development to the held-out year, so the final validation reports a distribution rather than a point | The human's. It is the substantive methodological addition of this round: it makes the holdout answer the veridical question rather than only the predictive one. | human-set |
| `chapkit` may be used to build our own models against the Chap contract | The human's; permitted, not mandated. | human-set |
| If EWARS cannot be run: stop, report what blocked it, and reconsider the reference together — a practical obstacle changes the reference, not the aim | The human's, correcting the agent's initial fallback to the two required baselines, which would have lowered the aim rather than preserved it. | human-set |
| The holdout perturbation manifest is frozen before the holdout is opened; nothing is added, dropped, re-tuned or re-run after a holdout number is seen | Proposed by the agent as the condition under which "spread on the holdout" stays honest, since the holdout is now opened once but evaluated many times. Accepted. | agent-on-human-assessment |
| Forks are of two kinds: those that change the data or the evaluation re-score every model including the reference; those internal to our candidates move only ours | Proposed by the agent. A comparison in which one side moved and the other did not is not a comparison. Accepted. | agent-on-human-assessment |
| The root's computed conclusion is a **skill score against the reference**, `1 − CRPS_ours / CRPS_ewars`, per analysis, with raw CRPS and coverage reported beside it | Proposed by the agent with the reasoning that raw CRPS is not comparable between development and holdout, so a raw dev→holdout gap confounds the agent inflating its own performance with 2010 being a harder year; a relative score controls for year difficulty and puts both spreads on one axis. The human chose it. | agent-on-human-assessment |
| `chapkit_ewars_model` is pinned by commit, and vendored if the URL cannot carry a ref | Agent's, unopposed. `chap eval --model-name <URL>` fetches at run time, so an unpinned reference would make the headline comparison depend on another repository's current state — the objection §3 already makes against running Chap as a hosted service, applied to the reference model. | agent-autonomous |
| If the budget will not carry the manifest twice, cut **forks run on both datasets** — never the full set on development and a subset on holdout | Agent's, unopposed. A holdout spread computed over a different set than the development spread is not comparable to it, so the asymmetric cut destroys exactly what the manifest exists to produce. | agent-autonomous |
| The plan as delivered is archived under `Archive/plan-as-delivered/`, and how it changes is a reported result | The human's, on the reasoning that how much of the original design survives the process, and what had to change, is evidence about how far an agentic system can be handed a plan and left to run it. | human-set |

### 2026-08-23 — settled by batch 2, from the installed platform

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| Phase E runs Chap's own path: `chap eval` on the full file, with `n_periods + (n_splits−1)·stride = 12` so the evaluated span is exactly 2010. The script-computed-CRPS fallback batch 3 was told to prepare is dropped | Batch 2 established that the evaluated span is `n_periods + (n_splits−1)·stride` and always ends at the last period of the file, so the arrangement §7's batch 3 called *preferred* is available. The plan reserved the choice to whichever route turned out to be configurable. | agent-autonomous |
| Phase E reads the **archived original** rather than concatenating the two split files | Answers the open question batch 1 raised at its §3.3. Concatenating would also demonstrate the partition was lossless, but the partition can be verified where it is made, and reading the original keeps the number of files that must agree at one. | agent-autonomous |
| This project never implements CRPS. Aggregation level is ours; the score is always chap-core's `CRPSMetric` | Batch 2 found that per-region and per-split values are recoverable through chap-core's own metric API, so the case the plan allowed for — a hand-computed metric, flagged loudly — does not arise. A metric we computed ourselves is the one we could most easily bend without it being visible. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-23 — settled by batch 3, from the data

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| The backtest scheme is `n_periods 3`, `n_splits 8`, `stride 3`, `n_retrain 1` on development, and `3, 4, 3` on the full file in phase E. It does not move again | Seven candidates were run and costed against the data. `stride 3` because overlapping splits break the balance batch 2's metric identity depends on; `n_splits 8` because four splits make the development estimate a statement about a single dengue season and twelve leave the one training fit ending 2006-12 while predicting through 2009. | agent-autonomous |
| `n_periods = 3` is not a free choice | It follows from the human's selection of `chapkit_ewars_model` as the reference: chap-core forces `n_periods=3` for EWARS and the chapkit service declares `prediction_periods: 3`, so a different horizon would mean the central comparison never happens. | agent-on-human-assessment |
| The headline mean is over **16 provinces and 371 cells**, not 18 and 408, and this is reported rather than corrected | Vientiane never reports and is dropped by Chap's own region filter; Xaisomboun survives the filter, which looks only at the training period, and still contributes no evaluable cell. This is what §2's metric computes on this dataset, and changing it would be changing the success criterion, which is not the agent's. | agent-autonomous |
| Data acquisition is not a node in the claim tree; the fetch script lives in `AI-internal/data-acquisition/` and its record beside the data in `Archive/lao-dataset/provenance.md` | The tree analyses dengue in Laos and starts from the archived file. A node writing into `Archive/` would also break the read-only rule. Same split batch 2 made for reconnaissance. | agent-autonomous |
| `(IS_SHADOW)` is recorded in `Archive/lao-dataset/README.md` and `provenance.md` rather than in the data files | The marker inserts a line into the document; inserting a line into a CSV edits imported data and breaks the checksums that make the import verifiable. The convention is written for text documents and the repository now holds data. | agent-autonomous |
| Where the holdout's 24 missing target cells fall was not examined | §3 permits row counts, provinces present and missing months, "and nothing further"; their positions are a pattern in the target. Phase E will need them and phase E can have them. | agent-autonomous |
| Node scripts run under `environment/chapenv`, and `node.py` generates `run.sh` accordingly | The generator emitted `../.venv/bin/python`, which resolves to nothing below the first level of the tree and named the repository's own machinery rather than the pinned analysis environment. A node's declared environment and its generated main script now agree. Rule 4 makes this a methodological change. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-23 — settled by batch 4, from the reference model

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| The reference is pinned by **image digest** `sha256:abd8098f…` rather than by a `@<commit>` model URL or a local build | The published image's `org.opencontainers.image.revision` label is the source commit `a4c2fa42`, so the digest pins bytes and provenance together. A local build would have pinned our layer and left its own `chapkit-r-inla:latest` base floating, which is weaker than what §4b's original decision assumed. | agent-autonomous |
| Batch 4's reference run is reconnaissance; **the reported reference score is produced from a node inside the tree** | A result produced outside the tree does not exist, and the tree does not exist until batch 7. At 149 seconds per backtest the duplicated compute costs nothing worth weakening the rule for. | agent-autonomous |
| The reference's **unseeded stochasticity is measured and reported, not worked around** — four identical runs, sd 0.196 CRPS, 2.1 % range | `scripts/predict.R` calls `inla.posterior.sample` and `rnbinom` and never `set.seed`, and the service exposes no seed. Rule 6 cannot be satisfied for the model the success criterion names, so the honest move is to quantify the gap: any margin against the reference under about 0.4 CRPS is inside its own re-run noise. | agent-autonomous |
| The unpaired split-level standard error (5.65 CRPS, 26 % of the mean) is recorded as a property of the *dataset*, and phase C must compute the **paired** per-cell difference rather than lean on it | Split-to-split variation is common to both models and cancels in a paired comparison, so the unpaired figure is the right answer to "how variable is forecasting difficulty here" and the wrong answer to "how small a model difference can we detect". Recording both prevents the crude number being quoted later as the comparison's sensitivity. | agent-autonomous |
| Candidates are implemented as `MLproject` models with a `uv_env`, native Python; `chapkit` stays permitted but unused | No candidate on batch 4's shortlist needs a persistent service, and the `uv_env` route needs neither Docker nor an image build. This exercises the human's §4 permission by declining it, with a reason. | agent-autonomous |
| Spatio-temporal GNNs are **ruled out as a family**; the superensemble is ruled out as an *integration* but retained as an ensemble of our own candidates; the mechanistic thermal backbone is ruled out as a backbone and retained as a covariate-transform fork | Each against the data rather than against the budget: 16 nodes and 144 periods is not a graph-learning problem; the one integrated superensemble needs covariates the Lao file does not have and is the sole failure in the library sweep; and the Lao temperature range sits on the rising limb of the suitability curve, where a mechanistic transform is nearly monotone in temperature. | agent-autonomous |
| Whether our candidates **refit at predict time**, as the reference does, is a fork rather than a convention | The reference's `train.R` is a placeholder and its INLA fit runs in `predict.R`, so despite `n_retrain 1` it refits at every split. A candidate that fits only in `train` would be compared against a reference that refits eight times, which is a difference in what is compared rather than in model quality. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-26 — settled by batch 5, from the design

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| The two kinds of fork become a property of the tree's shape: every fork under `02_setup` re-scores every model, every fork under `03_models/03_candidate` moves only ours | §4b's rule was a convention that had to be applied correctly each time it came up. Placed in the tree it is checkable, and a fork in the wrong subtree is visible as a misplacement rather than left as an oversight. | agent-autonomous |
| A third case is recorded beside §4b's two: the **scoring fork**, which re-scores every model without re-running any of them | Re-weighting the headline mean re-aggregates stored per-cell scores. It is §4b's first kind by semantics and a different thing by cost, which is what matters when the manifest is costed. | agent-autonomous |
| The combination is an environment variable `COMBO`, defaulting to `main`, and every node reads and writes under `results/$COMBO/` | It makes the main path combination `main`, so `analysis/run.sh` and the stability run are the same code. A separate stability pipeline would be a second implementation of the analysis and the two would drift. | agent-autonomous |
| Models are re-run only when a fork upstream of them moved; the reuse is a column in the manifest | Re-running the emulated reference under a fork that cannot affect it buys nothing. Putting the reuse in the file rather than in the driver's control flow keeps which numbers were computed and which inherited on the face of the record. | agent-autonomous |
| **The forecast horizon is removed from phase D's fork list** | It is forced by the human's choice of reference model — chap-core forces `n_periods=3` for EWARS and the chapkit service declares `prediction_periods: 3` — so a combination at another horizon has no reference to be compared against, and the root's conclusion is a ratio to the reference. A fork whose conclusion is uncomputable is not a fork. | agent-on-human-assessment |
| Population becomes two forks: what the **column** contains (setup) and how **our model uses it** (candidate) | They move different sets of models. Batch 3's single entry would have put a candidate-internal choice into the subtree that re-scores the reference. | agent-autonomous |
| The reference is re-scored **four times** wherever it is re-scored at all, on development and on the holdout alike | It is unseeded and the conclusion divides by it; an unaveraged denominator carries the ~2 % wobble batch 4 measured, which is the size of the fork effects the manifest exists to detect. | agent-autonomous |
| Tier 2 of the manifest — the pairs — is selected by a rule written before tier 1 runs and applied by a script | Choosing which pairs to explore after seeing tier 1's numbers is selection with extra steps, which is the objection §3 makes to an unfrozen holdout manifest, applied one level down. | agent-autonomous |
| Phase C ends when the leaderboard's best moves by less than **0.4 CRPS** in a batch | The reference's own re-run spread, so the smallest movement that means anything. A stopping rule fixed before any leaderboard exists is the only kind that cannot be adjusted to suit the leaderboard. | agent-autonomous |
| Alternatives children are lettered `a_`, `b_`, `c_`; sub-analyses children keep `NN_` | `AGENTS.md` §8 numbers node directories "in the order the parent runs them", which is the ordered case. Alternatives are unordered and mutually exclusive, and the manuscript's own worked skeleton letters them. Batch 7 makes §8 say so, as a methodological change under Rule 4. | agent-autonomous |
| `06_holdout` is not created until batch 16 | A node that reads the sealed file must not be runnable while the seal is on. After batch 16, re-running `analysis/run.sh` re-reads the holdout; that is reproduction of a reported result rather than a second look, and it is recorded once in batch 16. | agent-autonomous |
| Batch 7 additionally builds `02_setup`, `04_score` and the reference node | Whether a paired per-cell comparison on 371 cells can separate two models is batch 4's first open question and the most expensive one to discover late. It needs only the reference and one trivial model, both of which batch 7 has. | agent-autonomous |
| The §9 budget is expressed in implementation effort, and phase C is cut to four batches with an evidence-based stopping rule | Batch 4 measured a full backtest at one to three minutes, so evaluation is not what binds. Batches allocated on a schedule rather than on evidence are the expansion-without-decision `AGENTS.md` §6 names. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-26 — settled by batch 7, from the tree running

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| **The development backtest resolves differences of about 4 CRPS, and nothing below 0.57 CRPS can be attributed to a model at all** | Measured, not assumed. The paired per-cell comparison is two to four times tighter than batch 4's unpaired figure of 5.68, giving a standard error of 1.3 to 3.0 depending on how the correlation between cells is treated — but both baselines sit 2.2 to 2.8 CRPS from the reference and neither difference clears two standard errors on any reading. The floor comes from the unseeded reference compared against its own repeats, which is a difference of exactly zero contaminated only by its sampler. This is what §2's instruction to report the call as uncertain will mean in practice. | agent-autonomous |
| Phase C's 0.4 CRPS stopping rule is **left where batch 5 fixed it**, although the measured floor is 0.57 | A stopping rule adjusted after seeing a number is not a stopping rule. The difference is small and the rule is if anything slightly too permissive, which is the safe direction. | agent-autonomous |
| **Calibration and lead-time structure are reported beside CRPS in phase C, not after it** | They separate these three models where the headline mean does not: the reference's per-province 10–90 coverage never falls below 0.542 while our baselines reach 0.042, and at one month's lead a persistence baseline is level with the reference (16.43 against 16.54) while losing badly at three. A candidate selected on mean CRPS alone would be selected on the least discriminating thing measured. | agent-autonomous |
| Each fork gets **only its main-path child** until the code that runs a sibling exists | Batch 5's design and this plan's batch-7 paragraph differ; the narrower reading was taken because a sibling that exists but cannot run would pass `/validate invariants` and advertise an alternative nobody can execute. | agent-autonomous |
| A stage finds its input by **searching for the one child of the previous fork with results under this combination**, never by naming a child | It is what lets the stability driver swap a child without any downstream script changing. Batch 5's file contract needs the mechanism and does not name it. | agent-autonomous |
| Every model of ours reaches `chap eval` through **one shared script** | "No candidate is compared on a metric computed a different way" is a constraint this plan states for phase C, and it is cheapest to enforce structurally rather than by care. | agent-autonomous |
| `install-chap.sh` **installs from `lock.txt`** rather than resolving afresh and writing it | Rule 3. A rebuild three days after the environment was pinned resolved a different package set while the lockfile sat unchanged in git; `environment/Dockerfile` had always installed from the lockfile, so the image and the local environment would have drifted apart silently. Found by accident during the clean-room check. | agent-autonomous |
| The reference's run costs from batch 7 are an **upper bound**, not a measurement, and batch 12 re-measures them | The machine was heavily loaded by unrelated processes during part of the run. A contaminated figure would otherwise go into the manifest costing. | agent-autonomous |
| **The headline weighting fork is not to be cut from the manifest** without an explicit decision | The reference is beaten by both baselines in the two provinces carrying the most evaluated cases and wins nearly everywhere else, so a population- or case-weighted mean moves weight toward where it does worst. Batch 5 costed this fork as the cheapest in the project; batch 7 gives the first evidence that it may be among the most informative. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-27 — settled by batch 8, from the first candidate

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| **Model configuration reaches an `MLproject` model through a file assembled from the forks**, not through a file checked in beside the model | Open since batch 2. The route is chap-core's own — `--model-configuration-yaml` → `ModelConfiguration` → `model_configuration_for_run.yaml` → the `{model_config}` placeholder in the entry points. Assembling the file from whichever child of each fork ran means the forks are the only record of what the model is; a checked-in file would be a fifth record and the one that actually ran. | agent-autonomous |
| The project seed is derived per component as **BLAKE2b of `"<project seed>:<component>"`**, read from the settings table in `readme-at-start.md` | Rule 6 asks for one seed derived downward. Reading it rather than copying it means there is no second number that could disagree; BLAKE2b rather than Python's `hash`, which is salted per process. The candidate is the first component in the project that draws at all. | agent-autonomous |
| The candidate's default covariate set is **rainfall and mean temperature at a two-month lag** | It is the reference family's own published configuration for this country: `laos_eval_config.yaml` in `chap-models/ewars_plus_template`. Taking the same pair at the same lag makes the first configuration a comparable one rather than a differently-tuned one. | agent-on-human-assessment; the configuration was `agent-retrieved` |
| **No autoregressive term on lagged counts in candidate 1's defaults**, although a lag of three is available at every horizon | None of the four forks batch 5 placed covers it, and adding a structural term outside them would be exactly the silent judgment call this project exists to make visible. It is proposed to batch 9 as a fifth fork instead — which is the visible way to add it. | agent-autonomous |
| **The reference is not re-run when a batch only adds a model of ours** | It is unseeded, so re-running replaces the four repeats with a different draw and moves the denominator of every conclusion. What makes the comparison paired is that every model was scored on the same 371 cells of the same dataset, checked by comparing `dataset_sha256` across the specs — not that every model ran on the same day. | agent-autonomous |
| **The backtest's resolution is a property of the pair being compared, not of the dataset alone** | Batch 7 measured ~4 CRPS using the two baselines. The candidate's paired difference against the reference has a clustered standard error of 1.11, less than half of persistence's 2.99, because the two models are structurally alike and fail on the same cells. A candidate built to be unlike the reference is harder to distinguish from it, not easier — which bears on how phase C's remaining candidates are chosen. | agent-autonomous |
| Phase C's 0.4 CRPS stopping rule is **applied as written and not adjusted**: it governs whether a further *candidate* batch is added | Batch 8 moved the best of our models by zero. Batch 9 is candidate 1's internal forks rather than a further candidate, so it proceeds; batch 10's admissibility depends on what batch 9 moves. Whether "the leaderboard's best" was meant as the best of ours or the best candidate is put to the human in the batch-8 report rather than settled here. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-27 — settled by batch 9, from the fork sweep

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| **One-at-a-time fork effects do not add, and two of nine reverse sign** | Measured. Three forks worth 2.115, 1.870 and 0.648 CRPS when each was taken alone from the batch-8 configuration delivered **2.402** together, not 4.632; re-measured from the promoted configuration, the hurdle is worth 0.601 rather than 2.115, the per-province annual variance 0.051 rather than 1.870, and dropping the climate covariates changes sign. This is the most important thing batch 9 found and it bears directly on phase D: **tier 1 of the manifest measures a quantity that does not compose**, so the distribution of conclusions it produces describes each fork's effect from one place in the space and not in general. Tier 2's pairs were designed to catch exactly this, and they now have evidence behind them rather than a precaution. | agent-autonomous |
| The promotion rule — **a fork moves only if its best child beats the main path by more than the 0.57 CRPS floor**, takes that fork's best child, and the promoted combination is then run; backed off if it is worse than the best single fork by more than the floor | Fixed after the sweep's numbers existed and **committed before the promoted combination was run**, so it cannot have been fitted to what it decided. The threshold is batch 7's measured floor rather than a position in the ranking, which is what keeps it from being a rule fitted to the sweep. | agent-autonomous |
| The rule is **applied once**, not iterated to a fixpoint | The second sweep, taken around the promoted path, has two children outside the floor — `b_refitAtPredict` at 0.873 and `b_rich` at 0.821 — so applying the rule again would move two more forks, and again after that. Iterating is greedy coordinate descent on development CRPS, which is precisely the failure §8's phase C warns about and which one held-out year cannot diagnose. Stopping after one application is a decision with a cost, and the cost is stated: roughly 0.9 CRPS left on the table. Whether phase C should iterate is put to the human rather than settled here. | agent-autonomous |
| **The width defect and the autoregressive term became forks, not model changes** | Batch 8 proposed both. A structural change made inside the model would have been the silent judgment call this project exists to make visible; as forks, each has a claim, a premise computed before it ran, a score, and a sibling that stays in the tree. That the autoregressive term turned out to be worth nothing is a finding the fork produced and a quiet change would have buried. | agent-autonomous |
| A combination **inherits what it did not move**, through `COMBO_BASE`, and every inheritance is recorded in the file that reports it | Batch 5's design named the reuse and left it to batch 12's manifest column. A candidate-internal fork changes nothing the reference or the baselines face, and the reference is unseeded — re-running it would replace its four repeats with a different draw and move the denominator of every comparison for reasons unrelated to the fork. `analysis/run.sh` sets no base, so the reported analysis inherits nothing. | agent-autonomous |
| The fork sweep is a **phase-C selection aid** and stops at `04_score/02_aggregate` | A `conclusion.json` per sibling is the phase-D deliverable. Producing nine of them in batch 9 would report the stability answer before the manifest that makes it honest has been frozen, which is the freeze discipline §3 exists to protect. The driver therefore lives in `AI-internal/` and writes every number into the tree through the tree's own scripts, keeping only the cross-combination table outside it. | agent-autonomous |
| The convergence tolerance was **not relaxed**, although the promoted fit runs to its 200-round cap | A criterion adjusted after seeing a run is a criterion adjusted to pass. The parameters are stable to six figures long before the cap; the flag says `converged: false`, and the record says why. | agent-autonomous |
| Phase C's 0.4 CRPS stopping rule **does not stop the phase**: batch 9 moved the best of our models by **2.402** CRPS | Applied as written. Batch 10 is admissible on the evidence the rule asks for. The ambiguity batch 8 raised — whether "the leaderboard's best" means the best of ours or the best model on the board — is still open and still the human's. | agent-autonomous |

### 2026-08-27 — settled by the human, on batch 9's open question

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase C does not iterate the promotion rule on the main path.** Batch 9's decision to apply it once stands, and the reported analysis is the one that stopped | The human's reading of batch 9 §13: iterating is greedy optimisation on development CRPS, which is the failure this plan exists to watch for, and one held-out year cannot diagnose it. The 0.9 CRPS left on the table is accepted as the price of not selecting that hard | human-set |
| **The iterated path is run anyway, on a branch named `greedy` that is never merged**, as batch 21 | "It could be interesting to see where this would have taken us." What stopping cost is then a measured quantity rather than an estimate from one sweep, and the branch is the only place in the project where selection is deliberately pushed to a fixpoint — which makes it evidence about the method rather than a result about Laos | human-set |


### 2026-08-27 — settled by batch 21, from the greedy branch

| Decision | Basis | Agency |
|---|---|---|
| **Iterating the rule reaches a fixpoint in three rounds at 21.275 mean CRPS**, past the reference's 22.098 and past each of its four repeats individually — and changes nothing the project can conclude | Measured on branch `greedy`. The paired difference against the reference is −0.823 CRPS with a split-clustered standard error of 1.602: half a standard error, where batch 9's candidate was 1.03 on the other side. The main line's "we cannot separate these two" survives the counterfactual with the sign of the point estimate reversed, which is the strongest available evidence that stopping cost the project nothing it reports | agent-autonomous |
| **The cost of iterating is paid in the record, not in the score.** The first fork the rule moved (`04_fitTime` → `b_refitAtPredict`) is the one under which the model has no stored fitted object at all | A rule that selects on development CRPS cannot see whether the model it selects can be inspected. On the branch, `a_hierNB/results/main/fitted_model.json` is a 520-byte stub where the main line's carries seventeen annual variances, two blocks of coefficients and an EM history. This is the branch's most useful product and it is an argument for the main line's decision that the score alone does not give | agent-autonomous |
| **A second demonstration that one-at-a-time fork effects do not compose, with the sign reversed** | The lagged-count term is worth −0.075 around batch 8's configuration, +0.353 around batch 9's, and +0.582 once the model refits inside `predict` — it and the refit are complements, and no one-at-a-time sweep can see a complement. With batch 9's finding that three forks overstated their combined worth, **tier 2 of the phase-D manifest now has two independent demonstrations behind it** and is not a candidate for cutting | agent-autonomous |
| The holdout is **not** opened on the branch, and the branch's model does not join the phase-D manifest unless the human says so | The project has one opening and it belongs to the frozen manifest. Answering the branch's question out of sample would spend part of it on a path the project does not report | agent-autonomous |


## 5. How this plan is executed

**One batch per invocation.** `/do 26-08-22_dengueForecastingCase` runs the **next open batch**
in the ledger below and then stops and reports. Batch *N* is iteration *N* for the purposes
of `/do`: the batch's report is written to `AI-generated/batch-reports/` as
`YY-MM-DD_bNN_camelCaseName.md`, linked under `## Batch ledger` here, and the previous
report is never overwritten.

**A batch is sized to finish inside one session with room to spare.** If a batch is running
long, stop, write the report with what was established, and **split the remainder into new
batches** rather than pushing on and losing the record when the context ends. A batch that
ran out of context without a report is the one genuinely unrecoverable failure mode here.

**Every batch ends in exactly one of three states**, recorded in the ledger:

- **Done — produced** — it created or changed something in the analysis. The report says what,
  and where.
- **Done — expanded** — it produced no analysis output but replaced itself with more concrete
  batches. This is a legitimate and expected outcome, especially early. The report says what
  was learned that made the new batches possible.
- **Blocked** — it could not proceed. The report says exactly what is missing and what would
  unblock it. Then stop; do not silently take the next batch instead.

**Batches added by a batch are appended to the ledger** with a one-line aim each, in the phase
they belong to. The ledger is the live plan; this document is edited as the project runs, and
that is intended.

**At the end of every batch, without being asked**: `/track-result` for anything produced,
`/commit-run after`, `/validate invariants`. If invariants fail, fix the cause before the
batch is marked done. Never weaken a check to make it pass.

**The early batches genuinely do not know what the later ones are.** Batches 1–5 are
reconnaissance and bootstrapping; batch 5's entire job is to replace the sketched phases C–E
with concrete batches now that the ground is known. Phases C, D and E below are therefore
written as *aims and constraints*, not as steps — they say what has to be true when the phase
is finished, and batch 5 decides how.

## 7. Phase A — orientation and bootstrap

### Batch 1 — orient and set up

Read all five source documents. Then:

- Fill in `readme-at-start.md` from §4 above: seed, main environment, tracking level `full`,
  compute budget (§9), data governance. Leave the split point marked as *fixed in batch 3*.
  Replace the bracketed template text; do not leave a template describing a real project.
- Initialise git if it is not already, with the standard `.gitignore`. No remote (§4).
- Create `.venv` and record the Python version.
- Create `AI-generated/batch-reports/` with its README.
- Write the batch-1 report: what the project is, in your own words, and anything in the
  source material that looks inconsistent or that you did not understand. **That list is
  valuable** — it is the first evidence about whether the instructions work for someone
  arriving cold, which is a question the manuscript asks directly.

No analysis, no data, no Chap. Just a repository that knows what it is.

### Batch 2 — reconnaissance: Chap

The largest unknown, and the one everything else waits on. From [[chapOrientation]] §2 and §5
and the live documentation:

- Install `chap-core` locally, from a pinned version. Record exactly what was needed —
  including whatever went wrong, which is the part a reader will want.
- Establish the **model contract**: what a Chap-compatible model must implement, in what
  language, how it declares covariates and configuration, and how it is pointed at by
  `chap eval`. Read `minimalist_example_r` and at least one model from
  `github.com/chap-models` as worked examples of the contract rather than relying on the
  prose description alone.
- Establish whether `chap eval` accepts a **local model directory** or only a URL. This
  determines whether development can happen locally at all, so settle it early.
- Establish the **exact form of the reported CRPS**: over what it is computed, how it is
  aggregated, and whether per-region and per-split values are recoverable from the `.nc` or
  only the aggregate from `export-metrics`. §2 of this plan is not operational until this is
  answered. If per-region and per-split values are *not* recoverable, say so and propose how
  to obtain them; do not substitute a hand-computed CRPS without flagging it loudly, since a
  metric you computed yourself is exactly the metric you could be gaming.
- Run the documented example end to end, on whatever data the documentation uses, to confirm
  the install works before pointing it at the real dataset.

Output: `chapSetup.md` under `AI-generated/batch-reports/` — the install recipe, the contract,
the evaluation semantics, and a list of what is still unknown. Environment changes go through
`/pin-environment`.

### Batch 3 — reconnaissance: the data

- Download the three Lao files at a pinned commit into `Archive/`, unmodified, `(IS_SHADOW)`,
  with `provenance.md` recording the repository, the commit and the date.
- **Cut the data in two, first, before anything else looks at it.** A script reads the
  pinned original and writes two files: the **development dataset**, 1998-01 to 2009-12, and
  the **holdout**, 2010-01 to 2010-12. The script is a node in the tree like anything else,
  and it is the only thing in the project that reads the full file. Verify that the two
  partition the original exactly — every row in one or the other, none in both, none lost.
  Then confirm the holdout is complete and well-formed (row count, provinces present, no
  missing months) and **stop looking at it**: its case values are sealed until phase E (§3).
- Characterise **the development dataset only**, with a script whose output is stored: rows,
  provinces, time span, completeness per province and per year, the distribution of
  `disease_cases` (expect many zeros in the early years), seasonality, and how the climate
  covariates behave.
- **Resolve the row-count discrepancy** flagged in [[chapOrientation]] §4: the schema says
  2575 rows, the CSV has 2808. Establish which is right from the data itself and record the
  answer.
- Get the data into whatever form `chap eval` expects, and confirm the conversion is lossless
  against the original.
- **Fix the backtest scheme** used on the development dataset throughout: `n-periods` (the
  horizon), `n-splits`, and `stride`. Justify each against the data — twelve years of monthly
  data at admin-1 constrains how many splits are meaningful — and write the scheme into
  `readme-at-start.md`. It does not move after this batch, because a horizon changed midway
  makes every earlier number incomparable.
- **Establish how the final validation will be run**, now rather than in phase E, since it
  may constrain the backtest scheme. The preferred route is Chap's own: `chap eval` on the
  *full* dataset with `n-splits` and `stride` chosen so that every evaluated period falls
  inside 2010 and no training window extends past 2009-12 for the first of them — the same
  command, the same CRPS, the same data isolation as development. Establish in batch 2
  whether that is configurable. If it is not, the fallback is Chap's predict path plus a
  CRPS computed by script, and that script must first be **validated by reproducing a
  Chap-reported CRPS on a development split to within tolerance** — a metric you compute
  yourself is exactly the metric you could be gaming, and the only defence is showing it
  agrees with the platform's where both can be had. Record which route will be used.
- Note every data problem you find. Missing months, implausible zeros, provinces with almost
  no cases, the static population figure. Each is a candidate alternatives node in phase D,
  and this is where the list is built.

Output: `dataCharacterisation.md` plus the stored characterisation results and plots (with
their data, per Rule 7).

### Batch 4 — reconnaissance: methods

- Read [[trustAgenticSupplementary]] §S2 first: it names the families worth considering —
  Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models (INLA and similar), gradient-boosted trees on
  engineered climate-lag features, spatio-temporal GNNs over administrative units,
  probabilistic superensembles combining a mechanistic climate-driven prior with a data-driven
  residual learner, and fine-tuned time-series foundation models. It also names the
  knowledge-informed option: temperature-suitability curves for vector transmission as an
  informative prior or a mechanistic backbone whose residuals are learned.
- Then survey what exists: models in `github.com/chap-models`, and the published
  spatio-temporal dengue-forecasting literature. **Getting
  `https://github.com/chap-models/chapkit_ewars_model` to run on the development dataset is
  this batch's most important single task** — §2 makes it the model to beat, so the project
  has no criterion until its score exists. If it will not run, establish precisely what
  blocks it and report that; §2 says what happens then. Note also what other integrated models
  could be run, and whether any has already been run on Lao data.
- Assess each family against the actual constraints: 13 years, monthly, ~18 provinces,
  ~2,800 rows, three climate covariates, zero-heavy counts, and a *probabilistic* forecast
  requirement. Several of the families above will not survive contact with a dataset this
  small, and saying which and why is a genuine finding.
- Produce a **ranked shortlist**: what to try, in what order, with the reason and a rough
  cost for each, and what was ruled out and why.

Output: `methodSurvey.md`. Sources are cited; nothing about "the literature" is asserted from
memory (`AGENTS.md` §7).

### Batch 5 — bootstrap

The batch that makes the rest of the plan concrete. With the install working, the data
characterised, the metric understood and the shortlist ranked:

- Write the **claim tree design**: the root question, the sub-analysis decomposition, and the
  alternatives forks — which judgment calls become forks, which children each fork gets, and
  which is the initial main path. Check it against the three properties the manuscript
  requires of a tree that a stability run can walk ([[reproAgenticAiManuscript]], Appendix,
  *What a PCS stability analysis requires of the tree*): a shared output contract per fork, a
  script-computed conclusion at the root, and a pre-enumerated perturbation set with a budget.
  A fork whose children produce differently-shaped output has been placed too low — move it up.
  **The root's computed conclusion is fixed** (§4b): a skill score against the reference,
  `1 − CRPS_ours / CRPS_ewars`, computed per analysis by a script from the stored evaluation
  outputs, with raw mean CRPS and interval coverage reported beside it. Design the fork output
  contract so that this is computable at the root for every combination the manifest names.
- Write **concrete batches for phases C, D and E** into the ledger, each with an aim, an
  expected output, and a rough cost. Aim for batches that finish comfortably within a session.
- Revise anything in phases C–E below that reconnaissance showed to be wrong, and say what
  changed and why.

Output: `bootstrapPlan.md`, plus the ledger rewritten. This batch is `done — expanded` by
construction: it produces no analysis.

---

## 8. Phases B–E — what has to be true

Phase B is concrete. C, D and E state what the phase must achieve; batch 5 turns them into
batches.

### Phase B — make it run at all

**Batch 6 — vertical slice.** One trivial model (persistence is the natural choice, and it is
a required baseline anyway) implemented against the Chap contract, run through `chap eval` on
the development dataset, producing a real mean CRPS with its per-region and per-split values. Nothing clever. The point is that every link in the chain —
data → model → evaluation → metric → stored file — has been exercised once.

Until this exists, nothing about the modelling is real, and any effort spent on model design
before it is effort spent on assumptions.

The model writes the contract files batch 5's design specifies — the combination-scoped
`results/$COMBO/` layout and the per-stage schemas — even though only one child of each fork
exists yet. A contract first exercised when it has to carry alternatives is a contract first
tested in phase D.

**Batch 7 — erect the tree.** Build the claim tree from batch 5's design with `/node`, and
route the vertical slice through it so that `analysis/run.sh` reproduces the batch-6 result
end to end. Add the second baseline (seasonal climatology). Run `/validate invariants` and
`/validate cleanroom`: the clean-room check is worth its cost *now*, while the tree is small
and a failure is diagnosable.

Build `02_setup` and `04_score` with one child per fork, and add the reference node
`03_models/02_reference` running `chapkit_ewars_model` inside the tree. That gives the
**paired per-cell comparison** its first real test: batch 4 established what the *unpaired*
split-level spread is and argued the paired one is far tighter, and until two models have been
scored on the same 371 cells nobody knows whether the comparison can separate anything. It is
the cheapest thing in the project to check and the most expensive to discover late — if the
answer is that it cannot, phase C's design changes rather than phase D finding out.

Batch 7 also settles two things left open since batch 2: whether the Docker layer of
`environment/` builds, and the wording of `AGENTS.md` §8 on node naming, where alternatives
children are lettered and sub-analyses children numbered. Both are commits that say what they
change about the method.

From here on, everything happens inside the tree. A result produced outside it does not exist.

### Phase C — model development

**Batches 8–11** in the ledger. The claim tree they build into, and the fork inventory they
populate, are designed in [[26-08-26_b05_bootstrapPlan]].

**What must be true when the phase ends.** Several candidates from batch 4's shortlist have
been implemented against the Chap contract, evaluated on the **development dataset only**, and
recorded — each as a node, each with its provenance, each with its intermediates and its
plots-with-data. One candidate is the main path. The holdout year has not been opened.

**Constraints.**

- Every candidate is evaluated through the same `chap eval` path as the baselines. No
  candidate is compared on a metric computed a different way.
- A leaderboard file is maintained by a script from the stored evaluation outputs — never
  typed. It carries the candidate, its configuration, its development mean CRPS, its
  calibration, and its compute cost. `chapkit_ewars_model` and both baselines sit on it as
  fixed reference rows from the moment they can be run.
- Candidates that failed stay in the record, with what went wrong. A family abandoned because
  it could not be made to produce calibrated probabilistic output is a finding.
- Each round decides what to do next from what the last round showed, and says so. A round
  that reports only a number and no reasoning has hidden the interesting part.
- Watch for the specific failure the proposal names ([[trustAgenticProposal]], *Why this
  research is needed*): fitting the available data rather than the data-generating process,
  and brittleness to the chosen metric. Selecting hard on development CRPS across many
  candidates is precisely how that happens, which is what the held-out year exists to catch.
  Every rejected sibling stays in the tree and is re-run in phase D and on the holdout, so the
  cost of each selection is measured rather than argued about.
- **The phase ends on evidence, not on a batch count.** It stops when the leaderboard's best
  moves by less than **0.4 CRPS** in a batch — the reference's own re-run spread, and therefore
  the smallest movement that means anything. Adding a further candidate batch requires that
  the last one moved it by more.

### Phase D — stability and the veridical record

**Batches 12–15** in the ledger.

**What must be true when the phase ends.** The judgment calls are enumerated and costed
(`/perturb plan`); the ones within budget have been run (`/perturb run`); and the result is a
**distribution of conclusions over reasonable analyses**, not a single number
(`/perturb report`). What was not run is recorded as a decision, with the reason, not left as
an absence.

**The forks**, confirmed against what batches 3 and 4 found and placed in the tree by batch 5.
Ten of them, in two subtrees that decide which models a fork moves:

*Under `02_setup`, and so re-scoring every model including the reference* — what the
`population` column contains, given that it is a single 2020 snapshot applied to thirteen
years; how much of the record models may learn from, given that the zero rate falls
monotonically across it; which provinces belong in the analysis at all; and how often a model
is refitted across the backtest.

*Under `04_score`, re-scoring every model without re-running any* — the weighting of the
headline mean, over provinces whose burdens differ by four orders of magnitude.

*Under `03_models/03_candidate`, and so moving only ours* — the model family itself, with the
top candidates as siblings under one fork; the observation model for the counts; the covariate
set and the lag structure; how population enters our model; and whether our model does its
fitting in `train` or, as the reference does, in `predict`.

*Under `03_models/01_baselines`, and so moving one leaderboard row* — how uncertainty is
wrapped around a point baseline. Batch 6 found two published constructions for this that
disagree, and the choice sets the calibration of one of the two numbers §2's criterion is
defined against, so it is a fork rather than an implementation detail.

**The forecast horizon is not among them.** It is forced by the reference model, so a
combination at another horizon has no reference to be compared against and the root's
conclusion — a ratio to the reference — is uncomputable there. It is the one item of this list
that reconnaissance removed rather than refined.

**Also required**: a stated answer to whether the headline conclusion moves when a reasonable
alternative is taken at each fork, and which forks it is most sensitive to. That answer is the
most valuable single output of this project for the manuscript, and it is worth more than a
better CRPS.

**And the deliverable phase E depends on**: a **frozen perturbation manifest** — the exact set
of analyses to be re-run on the held-out year, committed before the holdout is opened (§3).
It names each fork, the children to be taken, the resulting combinations, and the estimated
cost of running the set twice: once on development, once on holdout. If the budget will not
carry the whole set to the holdout, cut the manifest here and record the cut; do not discover
the problem in phase E with the holdout already open.

**Which forks apply to the reference and the baselines.** `chapkit_ewars_model` is an external
reference at its own default configuration and is not perturbed as a model. But forks that
change the *data* or the *evaluation* — the split scheme, the handling of the zero-heavy
period, how population enters the dataset — change what every model is scored on, so every
model on the leaderboard is re-scored under those. Forks internal to our own candidates move
only our candidates. Record which fork is which kind when the manifest is written; a
comparison where one side moved and the other did not is not a comparison.

If the budget forces a cut, cut here — but cut *explicitly*, recording where the line fell and
what was below it. See [[reproAgenticAiManuscript]], *Trade-offs*.

### Phase E — closing

**Batches 16–19 in the ledger, with 20 optional.**

**What must be true when the phase ends.**

- **The final validation has happened, once**: the holdout year opened in a single batch, and
  the frozen phase-D manifest run on it — the final candidate, both baselines and
  `chapkit_ewars_model`, across every combination the manifest names — by the route batch 3
  established, producing the numbers that are reported. Report them beside the development
  numbers for the same models and the same combinations, so that development spread and
  holdout spread are read together. **If the holdout numbers are much worse than the
  development numbers, that gap is the most interesting result the project has** — it is the
  direct measurement of how much an autonomously optimising agent inflated its own
  performance, and it is precisely what the manuscript and the proposal are asking about.
  Report it plainly and do not explain it away. **Nothing is re-run or re-tuned after a
  holdout number has been seen** (§3). The reference is re-scored four times on the holdout as
  it is on development: it is unseeded, the conclusion divides by it, and an unaveraged
  denominator would put the reference's own re-run noise on every number reported.
- **`analysis/run.sh` reproduces the reported result from a clean environment** — verified by
  `/validate cleanroom`, not asserted.
- **Every claim is in `Human-AI-collaboration/claims/claims.md`**, each bound to a stored
  result: the headline claim about forecast performance, the stability claim about how far it
  survives the alternatives, the negative claims about what did not work, and the supporting
  claims under each.
- **`/validate outsider` has been run** on a fresh agent with no context, and what it
  misunderstood has been recorded and fixed. Run it late enough that there is something real
  to reproduce, and early enough that fixing the instructions is still cheap.
- **The hierarchical report** (`/hierarchical-report`) is built, with the tree supplying its
  upper levels and each node's within-result detail below that — national → province → month,
  down to the values.
- **The reproducibility report** (`/repro-report`) exists.
- **The plan's own drift is reported**: a short section, generated from the diff between
  `Archive/plan-as-delivered/` and the live plan and from that file's commit history, saying
  how much of the original design survived, what had to change, and — using §4b's agency
  column — how much of the change was the human's and how much the agent's. This is evidence
  about how far an agentic system can be handed a research plan and left to run it, which is
  a question the proposal asks directly and which no other part of this project answers.
- **The case write-up** exists: a short document that could be lifted into the manuscript's
  *An illustrating case* section — what the analysis did, what the main results are, what was
  achieved, and what the challenges and limitations were. **This case replaces the genomic
  region-set co-occurrence analysis** that the archived manuscript's Appendix still specifies;
  the archived copy stays stale by design, since `Archive/` is never edited. The write-up
  therefore also has to supply what that Appendix supplied for the old case: the worked
  claim-tree skeleton and the perturbation families, in dengue terms. *(human-set,
  2026-08-23, settling batch-1 report §3.1)* Write it through the two-step
  process of Rule 9: results → claims → text. Include, specifically, **where this setup was
  more trouble than it was worth**, which the manuscript's Appendix asks for by name and
  which nobody else is in a position to report.
- **`/release`** has assembled the repository, and stopped before creating any remote (§4).

**Optional, only if the budget survives**: run the final model unchanged on `tha` and `vnm`
and report what happens. It is a real external check and costs little once everything works.
It is optional because the project is complete without it.

### The counterfactual — the greedy branch (batch 21)

**Batch 21 in the ledger. It runs on a git branch named `greedy` and is never merged.**

Batch 9 applied its promotion rule once and stopped, on the grounds that iterating it is
greedy coordinate descent on development CRPS — the failure this phase warns about — and
that one held-out year cannot diagnose it. The cost of stopping was stated rather than
hidden: two children sit outside the 0.57 CRPS floor from the promoted path. This batch
pays that cost out on a branch, so that what stopping bought and what it cost are both
measured instead of one being argued.

**What must be true when it is finished.**

- The branch `greedy` exists, branched from the main line at the commit that closed batch 9,
  and **nothing from it is merged into `main`**. The reported analysis is the one on `main`.
- The iteration rule was **written and committed before the first round it decided was run**,
  as batch 9's was, and it is batch 9's rule with the single-application clause removed.
- Every round is a full sweep of every non-main child around the branch's current main path,
  a promotion, and a scored run of the promoted combination — through the tree's own scripts,
  under the same `COMBO`/`COMBO_BASE` mechanism, with the reference inherited and never
  re-run.
- The iteration ran to a **fixpoint** — a round in which no fork's best child clears the
  floor — or to a stated round cap, and which of the two it was is recorded.
- The branch's `analysis/run.sh` reproduces the greedy model, and its `conclusion.json` is
  computed by the same script as the main line's.
- The report says what the fixpoint scores, **how many rounds of selection produced it**, and
  what that implies for the holdout: a model chosen by *k* rounds of coordinate descent on
  development CRPS has had more opportunity to fit the development period than one chosen by
  a single application of the same rule, and the difference between the two is the size of
  the effect phase E is set up to detect.

**Constraints.**

- **The holdout is not opened on this branch.** It is not opened on any branch. The
  counterfactual is about how far development CRPS can be driven, not about what that costs
  out of sample — that question belongs to phase E and to the manifest, and answering it here
  would spend the one opening the project has.
- The greedy path's numbers are **not reported results of this project**. They are evidence
  about the method, and they enter the manuscript, if at all, as such.

  taken us".)*

## 9. Budget

Nineteen batches, plus one optional. The purpose is to make the trade-offs of `AGENTS.md` §6
decisions rather than drift.

**The unit is implementation effort, not evaluation runs.** Batch 4 measured a full
eight-split backtest at 149 seconds for the reference through the emulated amd64 image and 56
seconds for a native `uv_env` model, so the whole phase-D manifest is a few hours of compute
and the binding constraint is the work of building models, not of running them.

| Phase | Batches | Note |
|---|---|---|
| A — orientation and bootstrap | 5 (1–5) | Done. |
| B — vertical slice and tree | 2 (6–7) | Fixed. |
| C — model development | 4 (8–11) | Three candidates and their internal forks. Extended only by the stopping rule in §8: the last batch must have moved the leaderboard by more than 0.4 CRPS. |
| D — stability | 4 (12–15) | Cut *within* the phase if the budget binds — the manifest's tier 2 goes first — and record the cut. |
| E — closing | 4 (16–19) | Not compressible. A project that ran out of budget before the closing phase has produced nothing this plan wanted. |
| Optional | 1 (20) | The external check on `tha` and `vnm`. First thing cut. |
| Counterfactual | 1 (21) | The greedy branch. Off the main path, on branch `greedy`; it produces no reported result and does not extend phase C. |

**If the budget binds, protect phase E before phase C.** A well-recorded mediocre model is
worth more here than an excellent undocumented one — the manuscript is about the record.

## 10. Left to me, not to you

Bring these to me rather than deciding them:

- Creating a git remote, and the owner and repository name.
- Anything that would spend real money.
- Abandoning the local Chap install in favour of a hosted service (§3).
- Any change to §2's success criterion or §3's non-negotiables. (§2 was settled on
  2026-08-23 and is now fixed; substituting a different reference model if EWARS cannot be
  run is explicitly *not* yours to decide — §2 says what to do instead.)

Everything else is yours to decide, and the record of how you decided it is a deliverable.
